### Resetting password

<img width="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/bianshuyang/LabLink/assets/123330983/81a52053-f117-4fdf-bd87-f586c118097f">

3. Password reset successfully. Do note that if you have previously been given a verification code, you MUST use up the very initial verification code to be able to reset, even if a later verification code is sent. This is in place to deter spamming and unwanted resets. If in doubt, please contact the lablink team. Note: if you successfully go through the reset process, your old account's password and netid is cleared. Therefore, you could use old password again.


### Setting up profile
- Profile setup will not be available unless user logs in the system. Toggle to the netID attribute on the right top side to view the profile set up.

### Creating new research projects, applying to projects, and deleting applications or project.

1. Click on `Programs of Interest`
2. Scroll all the way down to the bottom of the page.
3. Fill in the detailed information.
   ![New Project Information](https://github.com/bianshuyang/LabLink/assets/123330983/d097fbbb-4080-47cc-8014-0d52553bca7a)

   * Sample application:
     ![Sample Project Application](https://github.com/bianshuyang/LabLink/assets/123330983/e18f35bf-296c-4f39-85fc-c3124767e0b9)

4. Click on `Create New Program`.
5. The logic of deletion, creation is very similar to that of the profile page, and is omitted here for brevity.

Visibility setting change:
We have opted for no visibility setting for program of interest for a professor's posting, because there simply exists no reason why an offering of a research position is to be hidden to someone. If the information is outdated, they could simply do a deletion on the program offering, and the user would no longer have access to the database item.

Nevertheless, students may wish to use the platform to save their drafts before their posting is visible, so the following two options are offered: visible to themselves or visible to professors.
<img width="640" alt="image" src="https://github.com/bianshuyang/LabLink/assets/52821055/a0ba3f26-0af7-491e-9faf-790eae3c44d0">

6. Additional Logics to the Application Page

Whether you are a logged in professor, student, or an unlogged in guest, you can view "the number of applications" whenever is greater than 0 counter is recorded for the program posted. This ensure you know well in advance whether your profile might get accepted by the professor before application, further easing the competiveness of the research program finding process. If you are not sure what it is, click on "What is it?" to go for a definition.

### Finding Professors
Available Features:
1. Sort by Alphabetical order
   ![Sort by Alphabets](https://github.com/bianshuyang/LabLink/assets/52821055/fb1ce872-9f99-4bfd-b616-60bc34c5be35)

2. Multi-select different disciplines (use Command on Mac, Shift or Ctrl on Windows)
   ![Discipline Selection](https://github.com/bianshuyang/LabLink/assets/52821055/931a6c35-2d20-4807-b53a-faadf8f40cc1)

3. Keynote Function: Enable your profile after editing it with an extensive text description, and then click "sort by similarity". This is a string similarity computation that determines your profile similarity to the professor, which allows you to understand your most important research interest given past experiences. Note: this feature's accuracy is strongly dependent on your profile completeness, and also on all professors who posted. Since no NLP was involved, the results might be only indicative. This is time-consuming given the number of professors.
   Example sort:
