# API Connection for Password Reset

The provided code is a Node.js server-side script for handling requests to generate and store password reset codes for users in a MongoDB database.

## Dependencies

The script uses the following dependencies:

```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');
```
MongoClient: This is the MongoDB driver for Node.js, allowing communication with a MongoDB database.

## MongoDB Connection URI and Client Initialization

```javascript
const uri = process.env.MONGODB_URI;
const client = new MongoClient(uri);
```

uri: Connection string for connecting to the MongoDB database, fetched from the environment variable MONGODB_URI.
client: MongoDB client instance created using the provided URI.

## API Endpoint

```javascript
module.exports = async (req, res) => {
  //Try Block...
    //If-Else Block...
  //Catch Block...
  //Finally Block...
}
```
Exports an asynchronous function as the module. This function handles HTTP requests.
### Try Block
```javascript
try {
    // Connect to the MongoDB client
    await client.connect();
    const data = req.body;

    // Define the query to check if a user already exists
    const findOneQuery = { user: data.user };
    const collection = client.db('myDatabase').collection('verify');
    const findOneResult = await collection.findOne(findOneQuery);

    //If-Else Block...
}    
```
Establishes a connection to the MongoDB database and retrieves data from the request body. Assumes the request contains a field named `user`.

Defines a MongoDB query to check if a user with the given `user` already has a password reset code stored.

### If-Else Block
```javascript
  // If a user with the given fields already exists, send an error response
  if (findOneResult) {
      res.status(400).send('User already sent code');
  } else {
        const insertResult = await collection.insertOne(data);
        res.status(200).send("Code documented");
    }
```
Checks if a user with the given `user` already exists. If found, sends a response with a status code of 400 ("Bad Request") and a message indicating that the user has already sent a code.

If the user does not already have a code, inserts the new code into the collection and sends a response with a status code of 200 ("OK") and a message indicating that the code has been documented.

### Catch Block
```javascript
catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send(`Error verifying user: ${error.message}`);
}
```
Catches any errors that occur during the try block and sends a response with a status code of 500 ("Internal Server Error") and an error message.

### Finally Block
```javascript
finally {
    // Close the connection
    await client.close();
}
```
Regardless of success or failure, the `finally` block ensures that the MongoDB client connection is closed.
