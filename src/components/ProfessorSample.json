I also use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to reconstruct the white matter pathways of a wide variety of other mammals, including dolphins, sea lions, coyotes, and the extinct Tasmanian tiger.Previous research was aimed at understanding the neurobiological basis for individual preferences and how neurobiology places constraints on the decisions that people and animals make. We used fMRI to measure the activity in key parts of the brain involved in decision making. For example, we have used this activity to predict the commercial success of popular songs \u2013 the first prospective demonstration in neuromarketing. These results have found application in understanding common stock investing errors, and more recently, in the stock market\u2019s reaction to earnings announcements.

To address these questions, Dilks uses a variety of methods, including psychophysics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in typical children, adults, and individuals with developmental disorders or brain damage, as well as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in typical adults - whatever it takes to answer the question.\u00a0AffiliationsFaculty,\u00a0Program in Neuroscience and Behavioral Biology (NBB)Member, HERCULES Exposome Research Center, Emory UniversityInvestigator, Emory Eye Center, Emory HealthcareMember, Center for Visual & Neurocognitive Rehabilitation, Atlanta VA Medical CenterTeachingPSYC 215: CognitionPSYC 385R: Cognitive Neuroscience of VisionPSYC 611: Cognitive Theory & MethodsPSYC 770R: Conceptual foundations of neurobiology and neuroimagingResearchResearch InterestsThe functional organization of human visual cortex and its origins.

Understanding how this system works, as well as what factors may be impacting it will open up improved methods of treatment as well as preventative measures for these debilitating neuropsychiatric disorders.TeachingPSY 110: Introduction to Psychology IPSYC 190: Freshman Seminar \u2013 Science of StudyPSYC 200W: Labs in Experimental MethodsPSY 322/NBB 370: Neurobiology of Learning & MemoryPSY 385R: Special Topics in Psychology \u2013 Neurobiology of PTSDPSY 494R: Psychology in the British Isles (Scotland/London, summer)Emory-Tibet Science Initiative (Sera Monastery, Bylakuppe, India): Mind/Body ConnectionPublicationsPubMedContact InformationEmailakazama@emory.eduPhone404-727-2706Fax404-727-0372Office LocationPAIS 397"

As an undergraduate, her research focused on examining courtship behavior in birds. During a gap year after graduating, she worked as a research assistant at UCSD examining grouping behavior in birds and social communication in honeybees (i.e., the birds and the bees). She then attended Indiana University for graduate school, completing her Ph.D. in Biology and Neuroscience, with a minor in Animal Behavior, in 2014.Her graduate research examined the evolution of the neural mechanisms underlying social behavior in closely related finch species that vary in sociality, ranging from highly territorial to highly social phenotypes. Upon receipt of an NIH Ruth L. Kirschstein NRSA Postdoctoral Fellowship, she joined the Psychology Department at Cornell University. As a postdoc, using the socially monogamous prairie vole, her research examined the development of social behavior and the social brain.Dr. Kelly joined the faculty at Emory University in the Department of Psychology in August 2018.ResearchResearch InterestsNeural mechanisms of social behavior; neuroplasticity; individual and species differences in behavior; development of the social brain; evolution of sociality.\u00a0Research AreasSome of the primary questions addressed in the Kelly Lab include: What are the mechanisms underlying social behavior? How has social behavior evolved over time, and how have relevant neural circuits changed within and across species to allow for the extreme variation in social behavior we see today? What types of environmental influences have an impact on social behavior and the brain? How does social behavior develop over an individual\u2019s lifetime, and how stable or plastic are social traits within an individual and/or species? To answer such questions, the lab uses an integrative approach and combines techniques from behavioral ecology, neuroendocrinology, developmental neurobiology, molecular biology, and genetics to study the mechanisms underlying social behavior.The Kelly lab utilizes a comparative approach to understand social behavior. If we are to truly understand the evolution of social behavior, we need to consider the fact that various aspects of social behavior evolved independently many times. Thus, we cannot assume that relevant mechanisms have evolved similarly in all species. In order to build a solid foundation on which we study behavior and the underlying mechanisms, it is important to examine a diversity of species within and across taxa. Doing so will ultimately help us determine the fundamental neural principles associated with the organization of particular social behaviors and how they evolved in relation to the behavioral ecology of an organism. To this end, Dr. Kelly\u2019s research examines the neural mechanisms that regulate social behavior in naturalistic contexts and across multiple social species from diverse phylogenetic taxa (e.g., estrildid finches, voles, African spiny mice, Mongolian gerbils).TeachingPSYC 110: Introduction to Psychology IPSYC 385: Humans of Tomorrow: Integrating Technology with HumanityPSYC 543: Cognitive and Social DevelopmentPSYC 770R: Techniques in Mechanisms of BehaviorPSYC 777R: Research Seminar A\u00a0PublicationsThe Kelly LabGoogle ScholarContact InformationEmailaubrey.kelly@emory.eduPhone404-727-8154Fax404-727-0372Office LocationPAIS 497WebsitesThe Kelly Lab"

For the past decade, we have\u00a0been studying a \u201csupergene\u201d in white-throated\u00a0sparrows that is mimicking the early evolution of sex chromosomes. This species has been called \u201cthe bird with four sexes\u201d because this autosomal supergene is present in only one member of each breeding pair,\u00a0segregates with male-like social behaviors, and is experiencing suppression of recombination and subsequent differentiation from its homolog, just like the mammalian Y chromosome. My lab has identified several genes\u00a0inside this supergene that appear to be causal for the behavioral phenotype, which although it is male-like, occurs 50% of the time in females.\u00a0I am also interested in sex differences in humans and how those differences impact education and public health. A major focus of my work is to investigate how sex differences are tested for and reported in biomedical research.

I am interested in how listeners interpret a talker\u2019s intentions, thoughts, and feelings, using both linguistic and non-linguistic aspects of spoken language. Speech is a highly complex signal. Speakers convey information intentionally with the syllables, words, and sentences that they utter. In addition, however, an enormous amount of information is conveyed through a speaker\u2019s individual vocal characteristics and style. Spoken language requires that the listener integrate what is being said with how it is being said. Understanding the interplay between the perception of the words and sentences of spoken language with the processing of non-linguistic properties of speech is essential for a complete account of spoken communication.Current ProjectsPerceptual Learning of Voice and Accent.\u00a0This project is designed to examine the role of talker and accent familiarity in spoken language. We have been studying how perceptual learning of particular talker\u2019s style of speech influences listeners\u2019 ability to understand the linguistic content of these utterances.Sound Symbolism. This project explores instances of linguistic reference that involve non-arbitrary relationships between linguistic symbol and real world reference. We are exploring the extent to which aspects of linguistic form resemble external referents in natural languages and the implications of this kind of sound symbolism for language representation and use.Auditory Imagery During Reading. This project explores the characteristics of auditory imagery for speech. Our studies examine whether readers simulate or image characteristics of human speech such as speaking rate and tone of voice when reading text passages. Of particular interest is whether the linguistic representations that are accessed during reading are auditory in nature? Do readers engage in a type of auditory imagery for speech when reading text?Prosody and Meaning.\u00a0This project is designed to examine the influence of tone of voice on spoken word recognition. We are interested in the integration of meaningful prosody, both emotional and non-emotional, with the semantic content of words and sentences. Of particular interest is how and at what point in the processing of spoken words listeners integrate tone of voice with linguistic content and whether this integration helps listeners to infer word meaning.Social Expectations and Spoken Language Use. This project examines the ways in which social expectations or stereotypes influence spoken language communication. We are interested in the expectations that are formed when hearing talker- and group-specific properties of spoken language and how these expectations influences ongoing language processing and representation. Of particular interest is the extent to which social expectations influences our tendency to vocally accommodate or imitate conversational partners.TeachingPSYC 209: Perception and ActionPSYC 215: CognitionPSYC 309/LING 309: Brain & LanguagePSYC 615: Concepts & LanguagePSYC 730R: Special Topics in Research GroupPSYC 770R: Topical Seminars in PsychologyPublicationsGoogle ScholarNygaard Lab WebsiteContact InformationEmaillnygaar@emory.eduPhone404-727-0766Fax404-727-0372Office LocationPAIS 483WebsitesNylaab"

Circadian rhythms and sleep, especially their implications for evolution of sensory systems and relevant brain circuits.\u00a0Research AreasReorganization after damage to visual and cognitive brain systems early in development\nNeural basis of \u2018blindsight\u2019.What neural circuits underlie visual awareness? In humans, blindness after damage to primary visual cortex (V1) can be followed by recovery of various rudimentary visual capacities that are typically not experienced as vision (\u2018blindsight\u2019). Amazingly, if the damage is sustained early in life, some awareness of the stimuli can also be present. Earlier, my collaborators and I showed that nonhuman primates (monkeys) exhibit parallel phenomena. Other work to date in our lab suggests that \u2018blindsight\u2019 is a function of distributed changes across a large array of subcortical and cortical regions. Our ongoing work in this area uses anatomical methods to identify changes in specific neuronal circuits following early V1 damage, focusing on chemically specific populations in the thalamus and on the cortical regions which contribute to conscious perception of stimuli in intact brains.Effects of early damage to the hippocampus on inhibitory circuits of the forebrain.How does early damage to vulnerable brain structures have lasting effects on other regions important for memory and social cognition? We are also collaborating with the Bachevalier lab at Yerkes to study how the brain reorganizes after damage to the hippocampus in infancy in a monkey model of neurodevelopmental disorders. This research focuses on identifying changes in portions of the frontal cortex that have been implicated in the etiology and expression of deficits in schizophrenia. Our ongoing work in this areas focuses on shifts in inhibitory circuits in the frontal lobe and other structures.Comparative organization of vision and the visual systemHow do the brains of highly visual species such as squirrels differ from those of less visual species (rats and hamsters) regarding organization of main visual structures? Comparative neuroscience seeks to identify components of brain systems which make up the \u2018common plan\u2019, to identify variations in brain structure that correlate with species and individual differences in behavior, and help understand evolutionary relationships. Our studies to date show that highly visual rodents (ground squirrels) have an overall organization of the visual cortical mantle that is strikingly similar to that of diurnal primates, along with compelling differences. We ask questions such as whether rodents show cortical and subcortical specializations for form and motion vision similar to those in primates, and how vision and behavior are expressed differently in nocturnal vs. diurnal species and individuals.Lighting, time of day, and circadian influences on behaviorHow do ambient lighting and individual activity patterns impact psychological states through specific visual pathways? How might differential exposure to light during development help \u2018organize\u2019 sensory and affective brain circuits and behaviors? Recently, we found both time-of-day and lighting effects on the perception of faces by human subjects. We are beginning studies using experimental manipulations of lighting in gerbils (which show individual differences in activity patterns similar to human chronotypes) to test hypotheses about the effects of different types and timing of lighting on emotional behavior and activation of relevant brain circuits.Current ProjectsEffects of ambient light on the development of brain and behavior (gerbils)Reorganization of frontal parvalbumin populations after early hippocampal damage (monkeys)Comparative organization of rodent visual thalamus (squirrels, other rodents)Interactions of music, music experience, and sleep (humans)TeachingPSYC 190: Freshman Seminar: Brain Challenge and Sports PerformancePSYC 209: Perception and ActionPSYC 324 / NBB 370: Sleep and Dreaming, Brain and MindPSYC 420WR: Psychobiology of Visual PerceptionPSYC 550: Fundamentals of Systems NeurosciencePSYC 770R: Neurobiology & Applications of Sleep and Circadian RhythmsPublicationsGoogle ScholarContact InformationEmailhrrodma@emory.eduPhone404-727-2391Fax404-727-0372Office LocationPAIS 385"

Following my year-long clinical internship at the Lafayette Clinic in Detroit (1987-88), I completed a three-year Postdoctoral Fellowship in Behavioral Genetics at the University of Minnesota. I have been a faculty member in the Psychology Department at Emory University since the fall of 1991. I was President-Elect / President of the Behavior Genetics Association from 2010-11 and am an Associate Editor of the journal, Behavior Genetics. I have been on the editorial boards of four other journals (Journal of Abnormal Psychology, Clinical Psychological Science, Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology, and Development and PsychopathologyResearchMy overarching interests are in developmental psychopathology and behavior genetics. In my lab we work at the intersection of psychology, statistics, and biology to understand the classification, causes, development, and biological underpinnings of psychopathology and relevant personality traits across the lifespan.Although we study psychopathology broadly, we also have a specific focus on understanding the causes, classification, and development of childhood disruptive disorders (i.e., ADHD, ODD, and Conduct Disorder [CD]) and externalizing behavior problems (e.g., aggression, psychopathic traits), as well as related personality / temperament traits (e.g., prosociality, Negative Emotionality), social cognitive mechanisms (e.g., perception of others\u2019 intention cues), and neurocognitive functions. A major focus of my research centers on disentangling and characterizing the genetic and environmental influences that underlie these traits and disorders, as well as understanding how such factors combine to induce risk for psychopathology. These themes and representative projects are described below.The Structure and Classification of PsychopathologyTo address these issues, I use developmental behavior genetic methods (primarily twin study designs) in which the genetic and environmental influences that underlie such disorders and behavior problems can be disentangled and their magnitude can be quantified. I also use these methods to gain a better understanding of comorbidity, in particular the extent to which common genetic and environmental influences may account for the overlap within and among childhood externalizing and internalizing disorders, and the covariation of these disorders with temperament and personality traits.Quantitative GeneticsIn addition to conducting twin studies to estimate genetic and environmental influences, I use molecular genetic methods to search for specific genes that may account for the genetic influences on these disorders and traits. Historically, most of the genes we studied underlie various neurotransmitter systems, though recently we have begun examining neuropeptide genes such as the arginine vasopressin 1a receptor (AVPR1a) and oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR). We genotype multiple markers to capture genetic variation across the genes and use omnibus gene-based tests, thus increasing the likelihood of obtaining replicable associations with disorders and traits. We also are transitioning from examining associations with specific genes selected a priori to conducting gene-based tests of data from Genome Wide Association Scans (GWAS) of ADHD, Conduct Disorder, aggression, and psychopathic traits, as GWAS provides more comprehensive and unbiased tests of genetic associations.Within the context of behavioral and molecular genetic designs, we have also examined specific environmental influences at a number of different levels (e.g., pre- and peri-natal influences, parenting behavior, neighborhood characteristics), neurocognitive endophenotypes (e.g., measures of inattention and impulsivity), and social cognitive mechanisms (e.g., hostile perceptual biases, and deficits and biases in the processing of facial emotions) that may underlie externalizing disorders and the development of aggression and psychopathic traits. We also are using twin study designs and sophisticated statistical methods (e.g., Confirmatory Factor Analysis [CFA], Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling [ESEM], and Item Response Theory [IRT]) to test alternative models for the hierarchical dimensional structure of psychopathology. Finally, I've recently co-authored or edited several pieces focusing explicitly on replication issues in our field.Molecular GeneticsIncreasingly we use molecular genetic methods, particularly genome-wide association studies (GWAS), to search for specific genes and biological pathways that underlie these disorders and traits. We have been involved in large-scale GWAS of ADHD, ODD, Conduct Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, antisocial behavior, and the Externalizing spectrum. We are particularly interested in gene-based and pathway-based association tests, genetic correlations among disorders and relevant traits, understanding the biological meaning of associated genes, and uses of polygenic risk scores.Within the context of quantitative and molecular genetic designs, we also are interested in examining neurocognitive endophenotypes (e.g., lab measures of inattention and impulsivity) and social cognitive mechanisms (e.g., hostile perceptual biases, and deficits and biases in the processing of facial emotions) that may underlie externalizing disorders and other forms of psychopathology, and the development of aggressionStatistical MethodsWe use a variety of sophisticated statistical methods (e.g., Confirmatory Factor Analysis [CFA], Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling [ESEM], and Item Response Theory [IRT]) to test alternative models for the hierarchical dimensional structure of psychopathology in general and externalizing in particular. In addition, we use meta-analytic methods and multivariate quantitative genetic analyses in our research. I've also co-authored or edited several pieces focusing explicitly on replication issues.Diversity and InclusivenessWe welcome lab members from diverse backgrounds. In an effort to reduce mental health disparities, we are also actively extending our studies and research findings in the above domains to examine sex differences and similarities and differences inunderrepresented groups, such as individuals from non-European backgrounds. Thus, an interest in and commitment to diversity and inclusiveness is important.Waldman Lab Research TopicsUsing Genome-Wide Data to Find Genes for Externalizing Psychopathology, including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Conduct Disorder, Aggression, Psychopathic Traits, and Antisocial BehaviorTests of Specific Genes as Risk Factors for Externalizing Psychopathology\nAssociation of the Oxytocin Receptor gene with Autism, Aggression, and Social BehaviorFinding Dopamine & Noradrenergic Genetic Risk Factors for ADHDMeta-Analyses of Genetic and Environmental Influences on ADHD and Antisocial BehaviorAnalyses of the Classification and Underlying Structure of Youth Psychiatric DisordersEtiological Relation of Temperament and Personality with Youth Psychiatric DisordersNeurocognitive and Social Cognitive Endophenotypes for ADHD and AggressionRigorous Tests of Direct Causal Environmental Influences on Child PsychopathologyExploration of Issues Related to Replicability of Findings of Psychological ResearchInformation for Prospective StudentsGraduate student applicants should have substantive interests in conducting research on the classification and underlying causes of personality and psychopathology. Specifically, a strong interest in disentangling and characterizing genetic and environmental influences on personality and psychopathology is key, as we use quantitative genetic and molecular genetic methods extensively in my lab. Our research thus integrates psychology, statistics, and biology. We also are actively seeking to extend our studies and research findings in these domains to underrepresented groups, such as individuals from non-European backgrounds, so an interest in and commitment to diversity is important. We use a variety of sophisticated statistical analytic methods on very large datasets, so a strong statistical background and keen interest in further developing one\u2019s quantitative reasoning and skills is paramount. Graduate students in my lab are expected to contribute to ongoing research projects in the lab, as well as to develop their own research program under my mentorship.Applicants with the following characteristics will receive the strongest consideration:1. A strong statistical background, as evidenced by having taken several statistics courses, and a strong interest in further developing one\u2019s quantitative skills.2. A strong coding background, with working knowledge of using R for generating statistical graphics and conducting various kinds of statistical analyses. Knowing Python also is helpful.3. Having worked previously in a researcher\u2019s lab for at least a year. Being a coauthor on publications and conference presentations also is highly desirable.4. Completing an Honor\u2019s thesis also is advantageous.5. Some post-undergraduate research experience is typical.6.

In 2014, he completed his PhD in Neuroscience at Newcastle University, using behavioral and neuroimaging approaches to directly compare artificial grammar learning in humans and macaque and marmoset monkeys. After a short postdoctoral position, he was awarded a Sir Henry Wellcome Research Fellowship to study the cognitive and neural systems supporting language-relevant processes in humans and monkeys. He joined Emory University in 2020, where his lab takes a comparative approach, studying humans and nonhuman primates to explore the evolution of cognition and communication, and the origins of human language.ResearchResearch InterestsComparative cognition, cross-species neuroimaging, language evolution, communication, cooperation, implicit learning, statistical learning.\u00a0Research AreasAs a comparative cognitive scientist, my research focuses on questions about what makes humans unique in the animal kingdom, and conversely, where might we have more in common with nonhuman primates than we might expect? I am particularly interested in the evolution of language, which is a human ability that appears remarkably different to forms of communication available to other nonhuman animals. However, my research asks whether some aspects of language may be supported by domain-general systems that might also exist in other species. My previous research has shown that some of the cognitive mechanisms and neural systems that support and underpin human linguistic abilities may be shared with closely related nonhuman animals.Research in the Wilson lab has a number of key goals. Firstly, we aim to identify core cognitive computations that support aspects of language learning and processing (using statistical learning, sequence processing, implicit learning and memory tasks). These can then be directly related to linguistic abilities in healthy populations of human adults and children, as well as clinical and subclinical populations (e.g., aphasia, dyslexia, etc.). The lab uses a range of experimental paradigms to test humans and nonhuman primates using the same behavioral methods (e.g., habituation/dishabituation paradigms, eye tracking, testing with touchscreen computers). These studies aim to help us understand which cognitive abilities might be evolutionarily conserved across species, and which might represent unique human specializations.Finally, we use neuroscientific approaches (including neuroimaging such as fMRI, DTI and EEG, and brain stimulation like TMS or TUS) to directly compare brain responses in humans and monkeys, to identify whether similar behaviors in these species are supported by the same or different neural systems. This work has the potential not only to provide insights about human evolution and the origins of language, but identifying evolutionarily conserved abilities is also critical to develop nonhuman primates as an animal model system in which to better understand these shared cognitive and neural systems.TeachingPSYC 325/BIO 325: Primate Social PsychologyPublicationsGoogle ScholarResearchGateContact InformationEmailbenjamin.wilson@emory.eduPhone404-727-7055Fax404-727-0372Office LocationPAIS 383WebsitesWilson Lab"

Her program of research leverages cognitive neuroscience, behavioral co-variance, longitudinal designs, and training studies to explore how language, literacy, and executive processes (attention and memory) interact to drive individual differences in linguistic development across the lifespan. Through her work, she aims to build more inclusive and comprehensive models of language and reading. Towards this aim, she focuses on extending existing theories in two novel ways: (1) increasing the linguistic diversity of the populations examined and accounted for in language and reading research, and (2) complementing current behavioral models with neurobiological investigations aimed at describing the multiple mechanisms that support skilled language and reading development.Prospective Graduate StudentsI will be considering applications this year for graduate enrollment in\u00a0the fall of 2023.

BrownProfessorResearchI am an historical and cultural sociologist whose research interests are centered on ontologies of race, racialization, and racism.The enduring questions that motivate my research agenda are: In the historical thrust of racial capitalism, how is racial difference invented, rationalized, and systemically imposed on human groups? And how do racialized peoples (re)make themselves within this dynamic context of systemic racism?While the former question concerns systems and structures, the latter has all to do with human agency. My research has examined these questions across a broad array of topics, including migration, education, collective memory, and social theory.I have published two book manuscripts: Gone Home: Race and Roots through Appalachia (UNC Press, 2018) and The Sociology of W.E.B.

Thus, I have studied such things as (a)\u00a0aesthetic classifications (e.g., the rise of the R&B genre in the early to mid 1900s; the evolving orchestral canon from the early 1800s to the present; the designation of \"all time greats\" in music and the arts); (b)\u00a0business strategies (e.g., decentralized production of multinational record companies; post-antitrust merger strategies of railroad companies; the widespread shift to online music); and (c) careers in creative industries\u00a0(e.g., how musicians and artists make a living in settings where sustained employment is scarce and where racial and gender boundaries are commonplace).My studies have taught me to emphasize the importance of historical context, to acknowledge how inequality gets built into that context (especially along racial and gendered lines), and to recognize the benefits of bringing multiple theories into dialogue.While much of my current research addresses music and creative careers, my interests are much broader than that. As editor of Poetics, for example, I enjoyed featuring cultural sociology that runs the gamut in terms of methodologies, theories, and traditions. As a professor, I often remind my students that sociology is defined by a diversity of topics and approaches.Research Topics: culture, categories and classification, inequality, media, music, work and industryKey PublicationsTimothy J.

More specifically, she uses a mixed-methods approach to explain differences in adolescents\u2019 ability to learn new technologies\u2014what she calls their \u201cdigital adaptability\u201d and measures on a 15-item Digital Adaptability Scale\u2014and looks at how differences in digital adaptability influence educational, occupational, and health inequalities.In education, she is currently involved in two projects. The first is in Chicago Public Schools and involves 26 schools and ~1300 adolescents from diverse demographic backgrounds. Thus far, research findings suggest that cultural practices\u2014particularly those at home, such as parents helping children overcome a fear of failure when learning technology\u2014may influence adolescents\u2019 digital adaptability more than access to material resources alone. Further, differences in digital adaptability are correlated with adolescents\u2019 educational and occupational aspirations, with potential implications for social stratification.The second project in education involves collaboration with investigators at Tufts University\u2019s Center for Engineering Education and Outreach. The project looks at how detracking in the comprehensive high school shapes students\u2019 technology and engineering experiences, including what factors structure educational opportunity, in what ways detracking changes or maintains traditional achievement hierarchies, and how teachers and students negotiate the changes brought about by detracking in terms of how they think about and engage in technology learning activities. Finally, the project investigates the implications of detracking for pathways beyond high school. Using a case-study approach in a demographically diverse comprehensive high school outside of Boston, including a survey of 1285 students, initial findings suggest a subtler form of tracking based on math level, highly gendered practice where very few girls engage in any in-depth technology or engineering learning experiences, and confirmation that students\u2019 digital adaptability is related to both technology and engineering course enrollment and future aspirations in these fields.In healthcare, Cassidy is engaged in a new project that focuses on explaining differences in children and adolescents\u2019 use of medical devices to manage Type 1 diabetes and investigating how differences in technology use may affect various measures of health, such as glycemic control.TeachingSOC 190: Schools & SocietySOC 221W: Culture and SocietySOC 389: Digital InequalitySOC 502: Qualitative MethodsSOC 798R: Sociology of EducationView online C/VContact InformationEmailcassidy.puckett@emory.eduPhone(404) 727-7164Office Location205 Tarbutton Hall"

She continued in that field for 11 years, first as a senior researcher at the Prudential Center for Health Care Research and then as a Research Assistant Professor at Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University.Although Dr. Scott valued her time in healthcare research, her primary interests are in the sociology of culture and gender, and in teaching. In 2007, she moved into a full time position with the Sociology Department at Emory University.\u00a0From 2014 to 2020, she was Director of Emory\u2019s Quality Enhancement Plan (QEP): The Nature of Evidence: How Do We Know? For more on the QEP, go here.\u00a0Dr. Scott focuses her teaching on making connections between the evidence produced by social research and everyday life. Her goal is that students use this evidence to understand the world more critically, be more reflective in their actions, and make more informed choices in their own lives.ResearchDr. Scott\u2019s research focuses on culture, gender, and work. She is particularly interested in how culture (e.g.: religion; gender role norms; local contexts) influences life decisions (e.g., career paths), as well as the practices around work and family. Recently, Dr. Scott worked with 19 undergraduate research assistants, over 4 years, on an ethnography of undergraduate college-to-career culture at a liberal arts university, exploring how student culture creates mechanisms of career funneling specific to the local context, yet also related to broader notions of career prestige and success propagated by elite institutions of higher education in the U.S.Current Research Project:Moon Shot Astronauts / Their Families: Exploring Image vs Reality in the Early Space Era.\u00a0My research project uses a sociological lens to explore the Moon Shot era, particularly Astronaut Groups 1-3 during the U.S. Gemini and Apollo Programs (1962-1972).

The first intersection is within the disciplinary boundary of sociology: between cultural sociology and political sociology. The second intersection is between two broader \u201cfields\u201d: general sociology and China studies. My primary identity is a cultural/political sociologist, but I also have enjoyed the cross-fertilization between sociology as general social science and China studies as a field of area studies. I adopt multiple social scientific methods, including ethnography, interviewing, discourse analysis, and historical analysis. My ultimate intellectual goal is twofold: to develop generalizable knowledge without sacrificing sensitivity to context-specific processes and local knowledge; to address important public issues without losing scientific rigor and intellectual depth.This research agenda has been reflected in two interrelated lines of research.\u00a0\u00a0The first line of my research interest focuses on civil society, particularly civic engagement, volunteering, the voluntary sector, and state-civil society relations. In my empirical work, I have addressed how a burgeoning civil society under authoritarianism interacts with the state\u2014in my case, contemporary China\u2014and how citizens and organizations understand the meanings of their civic engagement in an undemocratic context. This topic is addressed in my book The Politics of Compassion: the Sichuan Earthquake and Civic Engagement in China (2017, Stanford University Press), which has received positive reviews from more than ten journals and won the Mary Douglas Prize for Best Book in the Sociology of Culture from American Sociological Association (2018) and Honorable Mention for Best Book on Asia/Transnational from American Sociological Association (2018). The book draws on extensive data from interviews, observations, and textual materials to examine how individual volunteers, associations, and nonprofit organizations who participated in the rescue and relief effort after the Sichuan earthquake acted on the ground, how they understood the meaning of their action, and how the political context shaped both their actions and the meaning they attributed to them. This book not only provides a window on the world of civic engagement, volunteering, and voluntary sectors in contemporary China but also contributes to the cultural sociology of civil society by revisiting Tocqueville\u2019s \u201chabits of the heart\u201d thesis in an authoritarian context.My theoretical work on civil society advocates and develops a cultural sociology of civil society with a focus on empirical examination of moral-political values, civil society actors\u2019 interpretations of the values, and norms of interactions in civic engagement. This theoretical thinking was presented in a theoretical book that provides the first systematic survey of the cultural sociology of civil society and offers a committed global perspective on pressing issues in today\u2019s world: The Culture of Democracy: A Sociological Approach (Polity, 2022). In the book, I demonstrate that civil societies remain vibrant, animated by people\u2019s belief that they should and can solve such issues and build a better society. Central to this cultural aspect of civil society is the \u201cculture of democracy,\u201d including normative values, individual interpretations, and interaction norms pertaining to features of a democratic society, such as civility, independence, and solidarity. The culture of democracy varies in different contexts and faces challenges, but it shapes civic actions, alters political and social processes, and thus is the soul of modern civil societies.Second, collective memory. I have published a book and a few articles on the collective memory of China\u2019s \u201ceducated youth\u201d (zhiqing) generation\u2014the 17 million Chinese youth sent down to the countryside in the 1960s and 1970s. I draw on the data collected from 2007-2018, including life history interviews, ethnography, and archival research, to address how members of this important generation interpret meanings of their past difficulties and sufferings in the countryside, how those interpretations are represented and expressed in autobiographic memories, cultural objects, and commemorative activities, and what their memories tell us about this generation\u2019s mentality. This project aims to understand the Maoist legacy by reading the minds and hearts of those \u201cChairman Mao\u2019s children.\u201d It also aims to generate a theoretical framework from Karl Mannheim\u2019s and Pierre Bourdieu\u2019s theories to address a few general issues related to generation, class, and memory. The book, titled Chairman Mao\u2019s Children: Generation and the Politics of Memory in China, was published by Cambridge University Press in 2021. My previous work on collective memory also deals with WWII memories in China, nationalism, mourning, and disaster and trauma.My articles have appeared in leading journals.

Where does the molecular functional machinery of life come from? Why and how does it run? Is there a minimum set of the functional gears that represents a viable entity? Biological machinery is a complex system of many molecular interactions, both within and outside a single cell. We believe that the DNA blueprint of this machinery, the understanding of which is currently being improved with increasingly high-throughput techniques, holds many of the answers to our questions. Thus, our long-term goal is to understand how biological functionality is encoded in genomic data, whether by a single gene, a genome, a metagenome, or some combination of these. To this end, the Bromberg Lab develops computational, machine learning, and network-based methods for annotation and analysis of molecular functions.Specifically, we are developing methods to (1) Correlate genome variation to phenotype, (2) Identify the specifics of sequence-encoded molecular functions, and (3) Elucidate complex microbial community (and host) interactions.EDUCATIONPh.D. Bioinformatics @Columbia University (2007)M.Phil Medical Informatics @Columbia University (2004)B.A/B.Eng Biology/Computer Science @SUNY Stony Brook (2001)HONORS AND AWARDSTech Times highlight: 50 years of women at Tech (2020)Stony Brook University 40 under Forty (2020)Research Excellence Award, School of Environmental and Biological Sciences, Rutgers University (2017)NSF CAREER Award (2016)Rutgers Board of Trustees Research Fellowship for Scholarly Excellence (2016)Theobald Smith Society Young Investigator Award (2016)PhRMA Foundation Research Starter Award (2015)Hans Fischer Fellowship for Outstanding Early Career Scientists, Institute of Advanced Studies at Technical University of Munich (2014)Brooklyn Tech Younger Alumni Recognition Award for Career Progress (2014)ACTIVITIESMember, Technical Advisory Board, IIT Madras, India (2021-Present)Member, Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation (CAGI) Scientific Council (2020-Present)Member, Brooklyn Technical High School Advisory Board (2020-Present)Member, ISCB COVID-19 Taskforce (2020-2021)Vice-Chair, GRC Human Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms & Disease (2018)Chair, Proceedings, ISCB-Latin America conference (2018)Chair, 4-D Workshop for Deep-Time Data Driven Discovery (2018)Member, Editorial Board, Journal of Bacteriology (2018-Present)Program Chair, IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM) (2017)Chair, Computational Approaches to Understanding the Evolution of Molecular Function, PSB (2017)Chair, Computational Approaches to Study Microbes and Microbiomes workshop, PSB (2016)Guest Associate Editor, PLoS Computational Biology 2013-PresentChair (and VarI-COSI representative since 2014), VarI-SIG 2011-2019Contact InformationEmailyana.bromberg@emory.eduPhone404-727-9012Office LocationRollins 1001Office HoursBy appointmentWebsiteshttps://www.bromberglab.orgClose"

She is currently focusing on creating a lightweight Internet of Things appropriate for the home. Today\u2019s families use household objects to organize and manage daily life in idiosyncratic ways that resist generalization and differ from family to family. If the Internet of Things (IoT) is to fit with these idiosyncratic arrangements, it will need to be customizable, lightweight, and substantially cheaper (perhaps even <$0.10). To enable this kind of IoT, Kristin uses emerging techniques in backscatter communication to create a battery-free and wireless user interface that incorporates existing possessions into an IoT ecosystem through interactive stickers. Instead of replacing everyday objects in favor of internet-enabled equivalents (e.g., a smart bulb for a lightbulb), Kristin's work allows existing possessions to be upcycled with IoT: like giving an old, favorite teddy bear a friendly, voice interface. As a human computer interaction (HCI) researcher, she enables an Upcycled IoT by both studying how households use everyday objects and building lightweight, customizable technology to integrate with these possessions.EducationPhD in Human Computer Interaction, Carnegie Mellon UniversityMS in Human Computer Interaction, Carnegie Mellon UniversityMS in Human Computer Interaction, University of Maryland, College ParkBA in Philosophy, Reed College\u00a0Contact InformationEmailkristin.williams@emory.eduPhone404-727-7580Office LocationMSC W302-KOffice HoursMonday: 5:15PM - 6:15PM (in person)Wednesday: 5:15PM - 6:15PM (in person)WebsitesPersonal WebsiteClose"

The information is coded in a series of Access 2007 database files. We have also posted a preliminary codebook. This version will be updated as the databases are updated. A number of comments need to be made with regards to the database files. Be sure to read this information before using the data. 1. Access files automatically save all changes made to them upon entry of new information/edits. As such, it is extremely important that anyone who downloads these files is very careful about editing. 2. These files continue to be revised and cleaned as we work with them. As such, we will be sure to indicate the date of posting. Please be sure to check back with our postings when working with the data to be sure that you are working with the most current version. We of course greatly appreciate being told if errors are found that we can verify and correct. Our goal is to have as clean a dataset as possible. 3. Working with Access may be unfamiliar to some, but it is a powerful and relatively easy way to assemble working datasets that can be imported into Stata or any other statistical program one wishes to employ. The database consists of a series of \u00bftables\u00bf in which information is entered. These tables are linked through references based upon common variables. For example, the case number is entered into the \u00bfgeneral case characteristics\u00bf table and that case number is the reference variable for the \u00bflegal issues\u00bf table. Access provides a powerful tool, the \u00bfquery function,\u00bf to build datasets consisting of data from the various tables. We recommend that you use this function for constructing datasets consisting of whatever subset of the data you wish. 4. While we have posted the full databases, we do not have equal confidence in all of the coded information. In the codebook we discuss in detail issues we encountered in collecting the information. One variable merits mention here. At this point, we do not have confidence in the \u00bfissue area\u00bf data we collected. The choice of terms from the ECJ case books, it turns out, is not based upon a well-defined coding scheme from the Court. We have correspondence from the Court to this effect. Until cross-validated, we would recommend not using this information at this point.

She earned her PhD in Political Science from the University of California at Berkeley and her BA in Political Science and History from Rice University. Her work engages questions about the complex relationships between gender, race/ethnicity, and political representation, primarily in and around legislative institutions in the U.S. states. Her first book, Representing Women: Sex, Gender, and Legislative Behavior in Arizona and California won the 2023 Mac Jewell Enduring Contribution Book Award, given by the APSA State Politics & Policy Section. Her most recent book, Race, Gender, and Political Representation: Toward a More Intersectional Approach, is co-authored with Kerry Haynie (Duke University) and Kirsten Widner (University of Tennessee, Knoxville) and won the 2021 Richard Fenno, Jr. Prize for the best book in Legislative Studies. It examines how gender and race interact to affect the election, behavior, and impact of individual state legislators and demonstrates how intersectionality, as a critical epistemology, compels us to re-evaluate the entire study of gender, race, and representation. Prof. Reingold\u2019s current research focuses more intently on questions about legislative power and influence. It seeks to understand whether and how members of marginalized groups attain institutional power and how the institutions, norms, and processes that effect legislative power are themselves raced and/or gendered. With Irene Browne (Emory University, Department of Sociology), she is also working on an NSF-funded project on Black elites and the politics of immigration in the American states.\n                                    Research\n                                            Politics of Race and Gender | Intersectionality | Identity Politics & Representation in the U.S. | Research Design\n                                    Select Publications2021 Beth Reingold, Kerry L.

How do the dynamics of these pieces look as they interact with each other?While our department does not offer a formal research program (leading to a Masters or Ph.D. degree) in Physics Education Research, I do work with all of our graduate students during their time as Teaching Assistants. All graduate students participate, with me, in a year-long seminar during their first two semesters of TA work. More advanced co-teaching opportunities are also often available for advanced TA work.Contact InformationEmailtbing@emory.eduPhone404-727-0767Office LocationMSC - RM N236WebsitesGoogle ScholarMailing AddressN201 Math & Science Center400 Dowman DriveAtlanta, Georgia 30322"

For example, changes in molecular crowding may induce liquid-liquid phase separation and confer a fluid, or gel-like, nature to the genome, while the combination of tethering of DNA to membranes and the activities of processing enzymes (molecular machines) subjects DNA to pulling and twisting forces. We are interested in investigating the interplay of these forces and in measuring their effects primarily on, but not necessarily restricted to, gene transcription. The ultimate goal is to predict a spatio-temporal map of genome transactions as a function of force and torsional state to better understand gene regulation.Most of our investigations rely on complementary, experimental single-molecule techniques, such as the tethered particle motion technique, magnetic tweezers, atomic force microscopy and correlative confocal microscopy (C-Trap) which combines a dual optical trap, single-molecule fluorescence detection, and microfluidics.We develop instrumentation, software, as well as theoretical modeling as needed to achieve our goals.We are funded by the NIH and NSF and enjoy working with a cohort of diverse students and collaborating with colleagues worldwide.For additional information, please visit the Finzi/Dunlap web page at http://www.physics.emory.edu/faculty/finzi/Contact InformationEmaillfinzi@emory.eduPhone404-727-4930Office LocationMSC - RM N246WebsitesMyNCBIResearch LabMailing AddressN201 Math & Science Center400 Dowman DriveAtlanta, Georgia 30322"

Put differently, What are the computational primitives employed by living organisms to compute their way through life? We are trying to understand if there are phenomenological, coarse-grained, and yet functionally accurate representations of biological processes, or if we are forever doomed to every detail mattering. The dream is that, by stripping unnecessary details, we will eventually understand the basics of how we can function reliably in an ever changing world.I hope to achieve some quantitative understanding of such complex phenomena as evolution, sensory processes, animal behavior, human cognition, and, who knows, maybe one day even human consciousness. We use methods of statistical physics, information theory, and machine learning to address these questions. We solve purely theoretical questions, and in addition work tightly with experimental collaborators to understand how these questions apply to their systems.For example, different members of the research group study primate visual brain, work on neural signal transduction and behavioral responses of the worm C. elegans to sensory stimulation, model evolution and dynamics of cellular suicide, and explore multicellular, collective effects in cellular signaling.Contact InformationEmaililya.nemenman@emory.eduPhone404-727-9286Office LocationMSC - RM N240WebsitesLabMailing AddressN201 Math & Science Center400 Dowman DriveAtlanta, Georgia 30322"

Entanglement, Quantum Hall Effect and Fractional Chern Insulators, topological insulators and superconductors, Majorana fermions and parafermions.Research InterestsI am a theorist interested in quantum many-body physics. A particular focus of my research is toward topological phases of matter, which are systems exhibiting universal properties that depend on the topology of the many-body wavefunction rather than on the microscopic details. The quintessential example of a topological phase is realized in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect, where electrons, confined in two dimensions and subject to an external magnetic field, form a phase of matter with quasiparticles carrying a fraction of the electron's charge and possessing quantum statistical properties distinct from bosons and fermions.In recent years, the synergy between new theoretical ideas and experimental discoveries has greatly advanced our knowledge of topological systems and, more generally, of phases of matter.Topological phases are characterized by their quantum many-body entanglement instead of a local order parameter. One of my interests is understanding the constraints imposed by symmetries on the entanglement properties of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states, and how this knowledge can guide toward their experimental realizations. This research direction has led to our proposal of realizing SPT phases in periodically driven systems. I am also currently investigating the strong coupling between collective bosonic modes (e.g. phonons) and fermions in SPT systems such as topological insulators and superconductors.Furthermore, another goal of my research is to understand how the break down of Galilean invariance caused by strong lattice effects influences the hierarchy of fractional quantum Hall states. This question has direct implications in the characterization of topological order in Fractional Chern Insulators, proposed in 2011 by my collaborators and myself, as well in understanding recent experiments on moire' superlattices in applied magnetic fields.Contact InformationEmailluiz.santos@emory.eduPhone404-727-4298Office LocationMSC - RM N234WebsitesSantos Research GroupMailing AddressN201 Math & Science Center400 Dowman DriveAtlanta, Georgia 30322"

The goal of my lab is to understand how emergent cellular actin dynamics arises from complex interplay between numerous actin regulatory proteins and mechanical forces. Biological research over the last two decades has uncovered many proteins involved in cellular actin dynamics. However, we do not yet understand how these factors function together in complex multicomponent molecular assemblies to produce emergent intracellular actin dynamics.Further, actin filaments not only generate forces, but their dynamics are in turn affected by external mechanical forces such as those arising from membrane tension and the extracellular matrix. Using single filament and single molecule force spectroscopy, we are investigating how the actin cytoskeleton senses and responds to mechanical cues at the molecular scale.

Often novel physical phenomena arise when the dimensionality is reduced. For example, electrons in two-dimensions can exhibit a fractional charge. Using light as the main tool, we perform experiments to investigate the physics of low-dimensional materials with a goal towards control and manipulation of charge carriers and their internal degrees of freedom such as charge, spin and pseudo- spin. Some of the techniques used in our lab are nanoscale fabrication, magneto- optical spectroscopy, photon correlations, and electrical transport.A closely related theme is to understand the role of geometry and topology in solid- state using light-matter interactions. A non-trivial geometry of electronic bands (wave-functions) in a solid can result in effective electromagnetic fields in the reciprocal space. Can we use light to tune such fields? Is it possible to induce non- trivial geometry and topological states of light/matter using light-matter interactions? Our research hopes to address these questions.Contact InformationEmailajit.srivastava@emory.eduOffice LocationMSC - RM N232WebsitesQUANTUM LIGHT-MATTER LABMailing AddressN201 Math & Science Center400 Dowman DriveAtlanta, Georgia 30322"

The overarching goal is to develop fundamental understanding of the effects of confinement, interfaces, the resulting emerging interactions, and strongly nonequilibrium physical states that become possible to achieve only at nanoscale. For instance, we are investigating magnetism-related phenomena induced in nanoscale magnetic systems by spin-polarized electrical currents, at extremely high densities that would simply evaporate larger systems.Our goal is to understand the nature of dynamical and static states in magnetic systems brought far out of equilibrium by the current. We are also investigating the unusual physical characteristics acquired by the electromagnetic waves propagating in magnetic media. Such waves are called spin-waves. By engineering nanostructured magnetic media, one can produce nanoscale all-optical integrated cicruits for information processing and storage. We are also developing a new scanning probe microscopy technique to study electronic correlations at the surfaces of topological insulators and strongly correlated materials.Contact InformationEmailsergei.urazhdin@emory.eduPhone404-727-4571Office LocationMSC - RM N228 WebsitesGoogle ScholarUrazhdin LabMailing AddressN201 Math & Science Center400 Dowman DriveAtlanta, Georgia 30322"

Ultimately, we would like to understand evolution well enough that when, for example, a new antibiotic is developed, a reasonable number of experiments would be enough to learn how long it would take for bacteria to become resistant. This goal is just starting to become realistic due to rapid advances in sequencing technology. Now we need to solve a pair of theoretical problems in order to translate this sequence data into evolutionary predictions.First, we need to understand how to infer prevailing population dynamics from population genomic data \u2014 given a set of sequenced individuals, what can we learn about patterns of reproduction, migration, and adaptation in the population that they came from?Second, given these patterns, what do we expect the population to do in the future, and how can we test our predictions in scaled-down lab populations?
