        "author": "Eric Lee, Emory University",

        "description": "Systematic review (SR) is an essential process to identify, evaluate, and summarize the findings of all relevant individual studies concerning health-related questions. However, conducting a SR is labor-intensive, as identifying relevant studies is a daunting process that entails multiple researchers screening thousands of articles for relevance. Automating evidence synthesis using machine learning models has been proposed but primarily focuses on the text and ignores additional features like citation information. Recent work demonstrated that citation embeddings can outperform the text itself, suggesting that better network representation may expedite SRs. Yet, how to utilize the rich information in heterogeneous information networks for network embeddings is understudied. Also, the lack of a unified source that includes the metadata of biomedical literature makes the research more challenging. To deal with this problem, we propose four works. First, we propose a model that exploits three representations, documents, topics, and citation networks to show the effectiveness of the additional features. Second, we introduce the PubMed Graph Benchmark, one of the largest heterogeneous networks to date, which aggregates the rich metadata into a unified source that includes abstracts, authors, citations, MeSH terms, etc. Third, we propose a heterogeneous network embedding model that uses a community-based multi-view graph convolutional network for learning better embeddings for evidence synthesis. Lastly, we propose a hierarchical network embedding model that uses the Poincare embedding model on the MeSH tree and the citation network.",

        "description": "This dissertation explores the application of blockchain technology and the incentivization of behavior in emerging decentralized ecosystems. We investigate its application in the healthcare sector, with a particular focus on genomic data sharing. We also examine its potential in deterring illicit activities such as cryptocurrency fraud and explore its role in confidential tracking within decentralized delivery systems.\\\\\n\\\\\nWe propose efficient strategies for data storage and retrieval in blockchain systems, specifically targeting cross-site genomic data sharing. Our blockchain-based log system provides a lightweight and widely compatible module for existing blockchain platforms. By ensuring accountability in cross-site genomic data sharing, we demonstrate the feasibility of blockchain technology in incentivizing responsible behavior and enhancing collaboration across different healthcare entities.\\\\\n\\\\\nIn addressing the issue of illicit activities in the blockchain ecosystem, we design a virtual taint system that marks cryptocurrency transactions as \"tainted\" if they are known to be involved in crime, fraud, or other illicit activities. This system serves to disincentivize such activities, revitalizing integrity within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\\\\\n\\\\\nFurthermore, we present a blockchain-based system for the confidential tracking of routes in decentralized delivery systems. By leveraging the transparency of blockchain while preserving business confidentiality, this system reveals necessary information only when fraud occurs, thereby incentivizing honest behavior and enhancing trust within the network.\nOur research contributes significantly to both the understanding and incentivization of behavior in emerging decentralized ecosystems, particularly within the context of blockchain technology.

        "description": "Advances in techniques for measuring genomics in cell-level resolution provide great opportunities to reveal the cell heterogeneity. When dealing with single-cell genomics sequencing data, the most fundamental and critical step is to accurately identify cell types (celltyping). Once cell types are identified, the understanding of cell signatures, cellular composition and cell dynamics can broaden the knowledge of biological processes and potentially cure diseases. Traditional approaches of celltyping in single-cell genomics data are based on unsupervised clustering, expert’s knowledge, and manual curation, which are labor intensive. With continuous accumulation of high-quality single-cell genomics data, supervised celltyping becomes more and more popular due to its accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. In this seminar, the speaker will first introduce a benchmark study in supervised celltyping in single-cell RNA-sequencing data. Based on the experience gained from the benchmark study, the speaker will then introduce the supervised celltyping methods specifically developed for single-cell chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) data. Finally, with the accurately identified cell types, the speaker will introduce a method developed to identify cellular activity in bulk differential expression study with the usage of cell-type-specific marker information.",

        "date": "2023-04-20",
        "description": "The increasing reliance on machine learning algorithms has made them a target for exploiting vulnerabilities in these systems and launching adversarial attacks. The attacker in these attacks manipulates either the training data or test data, or both, known as a poisoning attack, adversarial example, or backdoor attack, respectively. They primarily aim to disrupt the model's classification task. In cases where the model is interpretable, the attacker may target the interpretation of the model's output. \n\nThese attacks can have significant negative impacts; therefore, it is crucial to develop effective defense methods to protect against them. Current defense methods have limitations. Outlier detectors, used to identify and mitigate poisoning attacks, require prior knowledge of the attack and clean data to train the detector. Robust defense methods show promising results in mitigating backdoor attacks, but their effectiveness comes at the cost of decreased model utility. Furthermore, few defense methods have addressed adversarial examples that target the interpretation of the model's output.\n\nTo address these limitations, we propose defense methods that protect machine learning models from adversarial attacks. Our methods include an autoencoder-based detection approach to identify various untargeted poisoning attacks. We also provide a comprehensive comparative study of differential privacy approaches and suggest new approaches based on label differential privacy to defend against backdoor attacks. Lastly, we propose a novel attack and defense method to protect the interpretation of a healthcare-related machine learning model. These approaches represent significant progress in the field of machine learning security and have the potential to protect against a wide range of adversarial attacks.\"",

        "author": "Zihao Wang, Emory University",
        "date": "2023-03-30",
        "description": "Context is a crucial element for conversational agents to conduct natural and engaging conversations with human users. By being aware of the context, a conversational agent can capture, understand, and utilize relevant information, such as named entity mentions, topics of interest, user intents, and emotional semantics. However, incorporating contextual information into dialogue systems is a challenging task due to the various forms it can take, the need to decide which information is most relevant, and how to organize and integrate it.\n\nTo address these challenges, this thesis proposes exploring and experimenting with different contextual information in the embedding space across different models and tasks. Furthermore, the thesis develops models that overcome the limitations of state-of-the-art language models in terms of the maximum number of tokens they can encode and their incapacity to fuse arbitrary forms of contextual information. Additionally, diarization methods are explored to resolve speaker ID errors in the transcriptions, which is crucial for training dialogue data.\n\n \nThe proposed models address the challenges of context integration into retrieval-based and generation-based dialogue systems. In retrieval-based systems, a response is selected and returned by ranking all responses from different components. A contextualized conversational ranking model is proposed and evaluated on the MSDialog benchmark conversational corpus, where three types of contextual information are leveraged and incorporated into the ranking model: previous conversation utterances from both speakers, semantically similar response candidates, and domain information associated with each candidate response. The performance of the contextual response ranking model exceeded state-of-the-art models in previous research, showing the potential to incorporate various forms of context into modeling.\n\n\nIn generation-based systems, a generative model generates a response to be returned to the conversing party. A generative model is built on top of the Blenderbot model, overcoming its limitations to integrate two types of contextual information: previous conversation utterances from both conversing parties and heuristically identified stacked questions that tackle repetition and provide topical diversity in dialogue generations. The models are trained on an interview dataset and evaluated on an annotated test set by professional interviewers and students in real conversations. The average satisfaction score from professional interviewers and students is 3.5 out of 5, showing promising future applications.\n\n\nAdditionally, to better understand topics of interest, topical clustering and diversity are investigated by grouping topics and analyzing the topic flow in the interview conversations. Frequent occurrences of some clusters of topics give a clear presentation of what scopes of topics an interview would touch on while maintaining a great selection of unique topics for individuals. Based on this observation, another generative model architecture integrating topical information is proposed that generates the next topic of interest in the conversation flow in parallel to generating utterances. This work is ongoing, with the expectation of improving the performance of the previous generative model.\n\n\nDay/time: March 30th, 11:00 am - 12:30 pm\n\nRoom: Math CS E306\n\nZoom Option: \nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/j/9910064905?pwd=aThaYVd1eFBkRWpwQ2xibFFneHIzUT09\nMeeting ID: 991 006 4905\n\nPasscode: 290751",

        "description": "Although end-to-end neural models have been dominating Natural Language Processing for both performance and flexibility, critics have recently drawn attention to their poor generalization and lack of interpretability. Conversely, symbolic paradigms such as Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) are humanly comprehensible but less flexible. In response, we propose Executable Abstract Meaning Representation (EAMR) as a reconciliation of both paradigms. EAMR is a neural symbolic framework that frames a task as a program, which interactively gets generated, revised and executed. In our novel definition, execution is a sequence of transforms on AMR graphs. Through a hybrid runtime, EAMR learns the automatic execution of AMR graphs, yet it also allows for the integration of handcrafted heuristics, knowledge bases and APIs. EAMR can be used in many applications such as dialogue understanding and response generation.\n\n\nhttps://emory.zoom.us/j/91398763361",

        "date": "2023-03-28",
        "description": "Data cleaning and integration is an essential process for ensuring the accuracy and consistency of data used in analytics and decision-making. Schema matching and entity matching tasks are crucial aspects of this process to merge data from various sources into a single, unified view. Schema matching seeks to identify and resolve semantic differences between two or more database schemas whereas entity matching seeks to detect the same real-world entities in different data sources. Given recent deep learning trends, pre-trained transformers have been proposed to automate both the schema matching and entity matching processes. However, existing models only utilize the special token representation (e.g., [CLS]) to predict matches and ignore rich and nuanced contextual information in the description, thereby yielding suboptimal matching performance. To improve performance, we propose the use of the attention mechanism to (1) learn the schema matches between source and target schemas using the attribute name and description, (2) leverage the individual token representations to fully capture the information present in the descriptions of the entities, and (3) jointly utilize the attribute descriptions and entity descriptions to perform both schema and entity matching.",

        "author": "Liyan Xu, Emory University",
        "date": "2023-03-28",
        "description": "Towards resolving a variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, pretrained language models (PLMs) have been incredibly successful by simply modeling language sequences, backed by their powerful sequence encoding capabilities. However, for document understanding tasks involving multi-sentence or multi-paragraph inputs, the model still needs to overcome the inherent challenge of processing scattered information across the entire document context, such as resolving pronouns or recognizing relations among multiple sentences.\n\n \n\nTo address the motivation of effectively understanding document context beyond sequence modeling, this dissertation presents an in-depth study on the incorporation of structural inference, utilizing intrinsic structures of languages and documents. Four research works are outlined within this dissertation. Particularly, the first work proposes to integrate syntactic dependency structures into the document encoding process, capturing inter-sentence dependencies through designed graph encoding for the task of machine reading comprehension, especially under the multilingual setting. The second work investigates different methods to perform inference on the discourse structure that concerns coreference relations, allowing for higher-order decision making. The third work presents a novel formulation of structural inference to facilitate joint information extraction, fusing multi-facet information of document entities in terms of both coreference and relations. The last work explores the potential of the sequence-to-sequence generation as an approach that performs implicit inference on linearized entity structures, motivated by its unified encoder-decoder architecture and inherent abilities to perform higher-order inference.\n\n\nOverall, this dissertation demonstrates that incorporating designed structural inference upon certain intrinsic structures of languages or documents can effectively enhance document understanding, and highlights that modeling dependencies among different parts of the context can lead to more accurate and robust encoding and decoding process, where auxiliary information can be provided that complements the sequence modeling of PLMs.\n\nZoom Option:  https://emory.zoom.us/j/95753738482",

        "date": "2022-12-09",
        "description": "Rare diseases affect 300-400 million people worldwide, yet each disease affects no more than 50 per 100,000 individuals. Many patients with rare genetic conditions remain undiagnosed due to clinicians' lack of experience with the individual diseases and the considerable heterogeneity of clinical presentations.  Machine-assisted diagnosis offers the opportunity to shorten the diagnostic delays for rare disease patients. Recent advances in deep learning have considerably improved the accuracy of medical diagnosis. However, much of the success thus far is contingent on the availability of large, annotated datasets. Machine-assisted rare disease diagnosis necessitates that approaches learn from limited data and extrapolate beyond training distribution to novel genetic conditions. In this talk, I will present our work towards developing few-shot methods that can overcome the data limitations of deep learning to diagnose patients with rare genetic conditions. To infuse external knowledge into models, we first develop novel graph neural network methods for subgraph representation learning that encode how subgraphs (e.g., a set of patient phenotypes) relate to a larger knowledge graph. We leverage these advances to develop SHEPHERD, a geometric deep learning method that reasons over biomedical knowledge to diagnose patients with rare–even novel–genetic conditions. SHEPHERD operates at multiple facets throughout the rare disease diagnosis process: performing causal gene discovery, retrieving \"patients-like-me\", and providing interpretable characterizations of novel disease presentations. Our work demonstrates the potential for deep learning methods to accelerate the diagnosis of rare disease patients and has implications for the use of deep learning on medical datasets with very few labels.",

        "description": "Embodied tasks that require active perception are key to improving language grounding models and creating holistic social agents. In this talk we explore two multi-modal embodied perception tasks which require localization or navigation of an agent in an unknown 3D space with limited information about the environment. First we present the Where Are You? (WAY) dataset which contains over 6k dialogs of two humans performing a localization task. On top of this dataset, we propose the task of Localization from Embodied Dialog (LED). The LED task involves taking a natural language dialog of two agents -- an observer and a locator -- and predicting the location of the observer agent. The second task we examine is the Vision Language Navigation (VLN) task, in which an agent navigates via natural language instructions. For both tasks, we address the objective of improving model accuracy and demonstrate that this can be done using passive data, which can introduce more semantically rich and diverse information during training, in comparison to additional interaction data. We additionally introduce a novel analysis pipeline for both tasks to diagnose and reveal limitations and failure modes of these types of common multi-modal models.\n\n\nBiography:\n\nMeera Hahn is a Research Scientist at Google Research working on multi-modal modeling of vision and natural language for applications in artificial intelligence.

        "description": "In recent years, representation learning on geometrics data, such as image and graph-structured data, are experiencing rapid developments and achieving significant progress thanks to the rapid development of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, DNNs typically offer very limited transparency, imposing significant challenges in observing and understanding when and why the models make successful/unsuccessful predictions. While we are witnessing the fast growth of research in local explanation techniques in recent years, the majority of the focus is rather handling how to generate the explanations, rather than understanding whether the explanations are accurate/reasonable, what if the explanations are inaccurate/unreasonable, and how to adjust the model to generate more accurate/reasonable explanations. \n\nTo explore and answer the above questions, this dissertation aims to explore a new line of research called Explanation-Guided Learning (EGL) that intervenes the deep learning models' behavior through XAI techniques to jointly improve DNNs in terms of both their explainability and generalizability. Particularly, we propose to explore the EGL on geometric data, including image and graph-structured data, which are currently under-explored in the research community due to the complexity and inherent challenges in geometric data explanation.\n\n\nTo achieve the above goals, we start by exploring the interpretability methods for geometric data on understanding the concepts learned by the deep neural networks (DNNs) with bio-inspired approaches and propose methods to explain the predictions of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on healthcare applications. Next, we design an interactive and general explanation supervision framework GNES for graph neural networks to enable the learning to explain pipeline, such that more reasonable and steerable explanations could be provided.  Finally, we propose two generic frameworks, namely GRADIA and RES, for robust visual explanation-guided learning by developing novel explanation model objectives that can handle the noisy human annotation labels as the supervision signal with a theoretical justification of the benefit to model generalizability.\n\n\nThis research spans multiple disciplines and promises to make general contributions in various domains such as deep learning, explainable AI, healthcare, computational neuroscience, and human-computer interaction by putting forth novel frameworks that can be applied to various real-world problems where both interpretability and task performance are crucial.",

That feedback may\n\ninclude clicking the items, reading important text content, query reformulation, and\n\nother interactions. They can reveal users’ latent intents and additional information\n\nneeds, providing essential extra information to improve users’ search experience.\n\nUnlike traditional search, the interactive search is enriched by more interactions\n\nand comprises three significant steps: Users browse the initial retrieval contents and\n\ngenerate feedback.

With the increasing number of safety and security-sensitive applications of deep learning models, the robustness of deep learning models to adversarial inputs has become a crucial topic. Research on the adversarial examples in computer vision (CV) domains has been well studied. However, the intrinsic difference between image and sequential data has placed great challenges for directly applying adversarial techniques in CV to other application domains such as speech, health informatics, and natural language processing (NLP). \n\nTo solve these gaps and challenges, My dissertation research combines multiple studies to improve the robustness of deep learning systems against adversarial examples in sequential inputs. First, We take the NLP and health informatics domains as examples, focusing on understanding the characteristics of these two domains individually and designing empirical adversarial defense methods, which are 1) RADAR, an adversarial detection for EHR data, and  2) MATCH, detecting adversarial examples leveraging the consistency between multiple modalities. Following the empirical defense methods, our next step is exploring certified robustness for sequential inputs which is provable and theory-backed. To this end, 1) We study the randomized smoothing on the word embedding space to provide certification to NLP models. 2) We propose WordDP, certified robustness to word substitution attacks in the NLP domain, leveraging the connection of differential privacy and certified robustness. 3) We studied the certified robustness methods to Wasserstein adversarial examples on univariant time-series data.",

        "description": "Gradient Descent(GD) and its variants are the most popular optimizers for training deep learning models. However, they suffer from many challenges such as gradient vanishing and poor conditioning, which prevent their more widespread use. To address these intrinsic drawbacks, alternating minimization methods have attracted attention from researchers as a potential way to train deep learning models. Their idea is to decompose a neural network into a series of linear and nonlinear equality constraints, which generate multiple subproblems and they can be minimized alternately. Their empirical evaluations demonstrate good scalability and high accuracy. They also avoid gradient vanishing problems and allow for non-differentiable activation functions, as well as allowing for complex non-smooth regularization and the constraints that are increasingly important for neural network architectures.\n\nThis dissertation aims to develop alternating minimization methods to train the Multi-Layer Perceptron(MLP) model. This includes deep learning Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers(dlADMM), monotonous Deep Learning Alternating Minimization(mDLAM), and parallel deep learning Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers(pdADMM). The extended pdADMM-G algorithm and the pdADMM-G-Q algorithms are developed to train the Graph-Augmented Multi-Layer Perceptron(GA-MLP) model.\n\nFor the dlADMM algorithm, parameters in each layer are updated in a backward and forward fashion. The time complexity is reduced from cubic to quadratic in(latent) feature dimensions for subproblems by iterative quadratic approximations and backtracking. Finally, we provide the convergence guarantee of the dlADMM algorithm under mild conditions.\n\nFor the mDLAM algorithm, our innovative inequality-constrained formulation infinitely approximates the original problem with non-convex equality constraints, enabling our convergence proof of the proposed mDLAM algorithm regardless of the choice of hyperparameters. Our mDLAM algorithm is shown to achieve a fast linear convergence by the Nesterov acceleration technique.\n\nFor the pdADMM algorithm, we achieve model parallelism by breaking layer dependency: parameters in each layer of neural networks can be updated independently in parallel. The convergence of the proposed pdADMM to a stationary point is theoretically proven under mild conditions. The convergence rate of the pdADMM is proven to be $o(1/k)$, where $k$ is the number of iterations.\n\nFor the pdADMM-G algorithm and the pdADMM-G-Q algorithm, in order to achieve model parallelism, we extend the proposed pdADMM algorithm to train the GA-MLP model, named the pdADMM-G algorithm. The extended pdADMM-G-Q algorithm reduces communication costs by introducing the quantization technique. Theoretical convergence to a (quantized) stationary point of two proposed algorithms is provided with a sublinear convergence rate $o(1/k)$, where $k$ is the number of iterations.",

In recent years, the growing popularity of commercial social VR platforms such as AltspaceVR, VR Chat, RecRoom, and Meta Horizon Worlds is dramatically transforming how people meet, interact, play, and collaborate online and has led to the emerging metaverse paradigm. These platforms have drawn aspects from traditional multiplayer online games and 3D virtual worlds where users engage in various immersive experiences, interactive activities, and choices through avatar-based online representations. However, social VR also demonstrates specific nuances, including full/partial body tracked avatars, synchronous voice conversations, and simulated touching and grabbing features.

In this talk, Dr. Guo Freeman will introduce her recent research on new forms of online harassment in social VR and how embodied harassment is becoming an emerging but understudied form of harassment in novel online social spaces. She will explain her ongoing work on leveraging innovative technologies, such as AI-based moderation, for proactively combating harassment in social VR. She will also highlight potential future directions for designing safer, inclusive, and more supportive social VR spaces to empower diverse communities, especially marginalized users such as women, ethnic minorities, and LGBTQ individuals.  \n\n\nBio:  Dr. Guo Freeman is an Assistant Professor of Human-Centered Computing in the School of Computing at Clemson University.

        "description": "Closely tracking the development of motor functioning in infants provides prodromal risk markers of many developmental disruption such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), cerebral palsy (CP), and developmental coordination disorder (DCD), among others. Screening for motor delays will allow for earlier and more targeted interventions that will have a cascading effect on multiple domains of infant development, including communication, social, cognitive, and memory. However, only about 29% of US children under 5 years of age receive developmental screening due to expense and shortage of testing resources, contributing negatively to lifelong outcomes for infants at risk for developmental delays. My research aims to learn and quantify visual representations of  motor function in infants towards designing an accessible and affordable video-based screening technology for their motor skills by developing novel data-/label-efficient AI techniques including biomechanically-constrained synthetic data augmentation, semantic-aware domain adaptation, and human-AI co-labeling algorithms. \n\nWhile there are several powerful human behavior recognition and tracking algorithms, however, models trained on large-scale adult activity datasets have limited success in estimating infant movements due to the significant differences in their body ratios, the complexity of infant poses, and types of their activities. Privacy and security considerations hinder the availability of adequate infant images/videos required for training of a robust model with deep structure from scratch, making this a particularly constrained ``small data problem''. To address this gap, in this talk I will cover: (i) introduction of biomechanically-constrained models to synthesize labeled pose data in the form of domain-adjacent data augmentation; (ii) design and analysis of a semantic-aware unsupervised domain adaptation technique to close the gap between the domain-adjacent and domain-specific pose data distributions; and (iii) development and analysis of an AI-human co-labeling technique to provide high-quality labels to refine and adapt the domain-adapted inference models into  robust pose estimation algorithms in the target application.  These contributions enable the use of advanced AI in the small data domain.\n\nZoom Option:   https://emory.zoom.us/j/95719302738",

        "description": "With the rapid advance in medical imaging technology in recent decades, computational image analysis has become a popular research topic in the field of biomedical informatics. Images from various imaging acquisition platforms have been widely used for the early detection, diagnosis, and treatment response assessment in a large number of disease and cancer studies. Although computational methods present higher analysis efficiency and less variability than manual analyses, they require appropriate parameter settings to achieve optimal results. This can be demanding for medical researchers lacking relevant knowledge about computational method development. In the last decade, deep neural networks trained on large-scale labeled datasets have provided a promising and convenient end-to-end solution to biomedical image processing. However, the development of deep-learning tools for biomedical image analysis is often restrained by inadequate data with high-quality annotations in practice. By contrast, a large number of unlabeled biomedical images are generated by daily research and clinical activities. Thus, leveraging unlabeled images with semi-supervised or even unsupervised deep learning approaches has become a significant research direction in biomedical informatics analysis. \n\n\n\nMy primary doctoral research focuses on the field of medical image processing, utilizing computational methods to facilitate biomedical image analysis with limited supervision. I have explored two ways to achieve this primarily: (1) Optimizing the model of existing approaches for specific tasks and (2) Developing semi-supervised/unsupervised deep learning approaches. In my research, I mainly focus on image segmentation and object tracking, two common biomedical image analysis tasks. By experimenting with different types of images (e.g., fluorescence microscopy images and histopathology microscopy images) from various sources (e.g., bacteria, human liver biopsies, and retinal pigment epithelium tissues), my developed methods demonstrate their promising potential to support biomedical image analysis tasks. \n\n\nZoom link: Join Zoom Meeting\n\n\nhttps://emory.zoom.us/j/97736956694",

        "description": "Many mammalian characteristics have evolved multiple times throughout history. For example, humans and dolphins have larger brains relative to body size than their close relatives, chimpanzees and killer whales. We want to identify the parts of the genome associated with these characteristics by comparing the genomes of hundreds of mammals. Rather than focusing on the small proportion of the genome that encodes genes, which cannot fully explain many of characteristics’ evolution, we present a new approach that uses machine learning to find conserved patterns of sequences at candidate enhancer regions, which control the levels of genes expressed in specific tissues. We established a new set of evaluation criteria for these machine learning models and used these criteria to compare our models to previous methods for this task. When applying our approach to the brain, we identified dozens of new enhancers associated with the evolution of brain size relative to body size and vocal learning.\n\nBio:\nIrene Kaplow received her B.S. in Mathematics with a minor in Biology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2010.

        "description": "Medical imaging plays a significant role in different clinical applications such as detection, monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment evaluation of various clinical conditions. Deep learning approach for medical image analysis emerged as a fast-growing research field and has been widely used to facilitate challenging image analysis tasks, for example, detecting the presence or absence of a particular abnormality, diagnosis of a particular tumor subtype. However, one important requisite is the large amount of annotated data for supervised training, which is often lacking in medicine due to the expensive and time-consuming expert-driven data curation process. Data insufficiency in medical images is also limited by healthcare data privacy requirements, which leads to barriers in the usage of deep learning methods across institutions.\n\n\nThis thesis focuses on facilitating the applications of deep learning approaches to solve automatic medical image analysis tasks efficiently under limited supervision.  Three situations are in consideration: (1) no annotated data; (2) limited annotated data; (3) curation of additional annotated data with minimal human supervision.  The research covers multiple medical image modalities starting from fluorescence microscopy images (FMI), histopathological microscopy images (HMI) to mammogram images (MG), computed tomography (CT), chest radiographs (X-ray). The researched tasks are diverse including image segmentation, Out-of-Distribution (OOD) identification and medical image retrieval. The diversity and concreteness of the thesis can be a guide to facilitate the efficient usage of deep learning approaches in future medical image analysis with minimal cost.",

However, as social technologies mediate more aspects of daily life and enable new forms of collaboration, members of the public are increasingly leading their own investigations, with mixed results. In this talk, I present three projects from my research group, the Crowd Intelligence Lab, where we build software tools that bring together crowds, experts, and AI to support ethical and effective investigations and solve mysteries. In the CrowdIA project, we adapted the sense making loop for intelligence analysts to enable novice crowds to discover a hidden terrorist plot within large quantities of textual evidence documents. In \nthe GroundTruth project, we developed a novel diagramming technique to enable novice crowds to collaborate with expert investigators to verify (or debunk) photos and videos shared on social media. In the Photo Sleuth project, we built and launched a free public website with over 10,000 registered users who employ AI-based face recognition to identify unknown soldiers in historical portraits from the American Civil War era.

This effect where the behavior of two or more people involved in a\nface-to-face conversation become more synchronized with each other, so that they can appear to behave almost in direct response to one another, is termed interactional synchrony. The ability to computationally estimate interactional synchrony can therefore be explored to explain other deeper social psychology constructs.\n??????\nIn this presentation, we discuss the analysis and synthesis of dyadic interactions under various social constellations, in the context of\ninteractional synchrony. We demonstrate how this can be useful for evaluating rapport, exploring the role of entrainment in intimate partner violence, and understanding parent-infant interactions. We use various behavioral features such as facial expressions, head movements and speech prosody, which are treated as sampled time series signals, with sequence-based machine learning methods to make some useful predictions on real-life datasets.

        "description": "Understanding the impact of genomic variations and epigenomic modifications is important for discovering the mechanism of complex diseases. Over the last two decades, thousands of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) have identified tens of thousands of disease-susceptibility loci that are associated with certain diseases. In addition to the association studies, many machine learning approaches have been applied to predict the pathogenicity of genetic variants and epigenetic modification.  For example, logistic regression was used in CADD that prioritized functional, deleterious, and pathogenic variants. Random forests were used in GWAVA to distinguish disease-implicated variants from benign variants. A hybrid two-stage model with support vector machine, random forests, logistic regression, the Lasso and elastic net was used in BioMM to identify epigenetic signatures of schizophrenia. \n\n In my thesis, I proposed several machine learning predictive models with different focuses on genomic and epigenomic variants annotations, which includes 1) EWASplus, an ensemble learning based framework for the risk prediction of DNA methylation loci associated with Alzheimer’s Disease, 2) CASAVA (Disease Category-specific Annotation of Variants), a disease category risk annotation for whole genome wide SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphism), 3) DRAFT (Disease Risk Annotation with Few shoTs learning), an end-to-end deep learning based approach that incorporates contrastive learning to tackle the lack of risk variants that hinder the application of traditional deep learning models to this research field.

        "description": "Filtering tasks have a broad range of applications in mining user-generated data. Examples include public health monitoring, product monitoring, user satisfaction analysis, crisis management, and hate speech detection. This dissertation proposes methods and techniques to overcome one of the primary challenges of these tasks, i.e., the lack of enough training data. It has four main contributions. First, it employs semi-supervised learning and proposes a novel method based on self-training and pseudo labeling to use unlabeled data. Our model uses the pretraining-finetuning paradigm in a semi-supervised setting to use unlabeled data for model initialization. It also employs a novel learning rate schedule to exploit noisy pseudo-labels as a means to explore the loss surface. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of these strategies.  Second, it proposes a novel active learning model when additional labels can be obtained for a range of tasks. Specifically, we use a multi-view model to extract two views from documents, and then, we propose a novel acquisition function to aggregate the informativeness and the representativeness metrics for querying additional labels. We analytically argue that our acquisition function incorporates document contexts into the active learning query process. We also treat the highly informal language of users in social media as a factor that manifests itself in the output of learners and causes a high variance. Therefore, we employ a query-by-committee model as a variance reduction technique to combat this undesired effect. Our experiments show that our model significantly outperforms existing models.Third, it exploits unlabeled documents in a multi-view model  . We propose a novel algorithm for one of the most challenging filtering tasks in social media, i.e., the adverse drug reaction monitoring task. Here, we propose a pair of loss functions to pretrain and then finetune the classifier in each view by the pseudo-labels obtained in the other view. Therefore, we effectively transfer the knowledge obtained in one view to the classifier in the other view. We empirically demonstrate that this model is the first known algorithm that outperforms the multi-layer transformer models pretrained on domain specific data.  Finally, we observe that although in many cases labeled data is not available, annotated data for semantically similar tasks is available. Motivated by this, we formulate a new problem and propose an algorithm for single-source domain adaptation. We assume that in addition to the source and target data, we can access a set of unlabeled auxiliary domains. We empirically show that existing state-of-the-art models are unable to effectively use this type of data. We then propose a novel algorithm based on the uncertainty in output predictions to decompose the target data into two sets. Then, we show that training using the set of confidently labeled target documents along the auxiliary unlabeled data yields a classifier that is highly effective in the regions close to the classification decision boundaries. The experiments testify that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art in this new problem setting.",

        "description": "Tensors are a popular algebraic structure for a wide range of applications, due to their exceptional capability to model multidimensional relationships of the data. Among them, regular tensors with aligned dimensions for all modes have been extensively studied, for which various tensor factorization structures are proposed depending on the applications. However, regular tensor decomposition is incapable of handling many real-world cases involving time, due to its irregularity. Electronic health records (EHRs) are often generated and collected across a large number of patients featuring distinctive medical conditions and clinical progress over a long period of time, which results in unaligned records along the time dimension. Recently, PARAFAC2 has been re-popularized for successfully extracting meaningful medical concepts (phenotypes) from such temporal EHR by irregular tensor factorization.\n \nHowever, existing PARAFAC2 methods suffer from three major limitations that impact their applicability to practical temporal EHR data analysis: 1) they are not robust to missing and erroneous elements in the data; 2) they fail to model the non-linear temporal dependency of patients' disease states, and are designed only for a single data type -- numeric or binary; 3) they are completely unsupervised, i.e., they attempt to learn the latent factors to best recover the original observations without considering downstream predictive tasks. While there are models that use extracted phenotypes for predictive tasks, they are trained separately and only consider a single prediction task, which ignores auxiliary information from other predictive tasks.\n \nTo address these limitations, we make three main contributions in this dissertation.  We first propose a robust PARAFAC2 tensor factorization method for irregular tensors with a new low-rank regularization function to handle potentially missing and erroneous entries in the input data.  We then propose a generalized, low-rank Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) regularized robust irregular tensor factorization for more accurate temporal modeling, with the flexibiity to choose from different losses to best suit different types of data in practice. Finally, we propose a supervised irregular tensor factorization framework with multi-task learning for joint optimization of phenotype extraction and predictive learning, which can yield not only more meaningful phenotypes but also better predictive accuracy.\n \n**Join Zoom Meeting**\nVenue:   https://emory.zoom.us/j/2878070037",

        "description": "While microscopic examination of tumor resections and biopsies has been a cornerstone in breast cancer grading for decades, it suffers from considerable inter-rater variability due to perceptual limitations and high clinical caseloads. Computational analysis of whole-slide image scans using convolutional neural networks (CNN) can help address this challenge. Unfortunately, CNNs can be difficult to interpret, which motivates our adoption of an approach called concept bottlenecking, where models first detect various tissue structures then use them to make their prediction. Concept bottleneck models require a large set of manual annotation data to train. Unfortunately, manual delineation of histopathologic structures is very demanding and impractical given pathologists’ time constraints. This dissertation describes contributions that fall under the themes of scalable data collection, deep learning-based tissue detection, and the discovery of novel histopathologic biomarkers and associations. \n\nFirst, we examine crowdsourcing approaches that engage medical students to collect manual annotation data. Our results show that a structured, collaborative approach with pathologist supervision is scalable; the resultant publicly-released BCSS and NuCLS datasets contain 20,000 and 200,000 annotations of tissue regions and nuclei, respectively. We show that medical students produce accurate annotations for predominant, visually distinctive structures and that algorithmic suggestions help scale and improve the accuracy of annotations.\n\n\nSecond, we describe a set of CNN modeling approaches for the accurate delineation of histopathologic structures. We describe various improvements to enhance the performance of nucleus detection CNN models and introduce a technique called Decision Tree Approximation of Learned Embeddings, which helps explain CNN nucleus classifications without compromising prediction accuracy. Additionally, we offer consensus recommendations from the International Immuno-Oncology Working Group surrounding the computational detection of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, a critical emerging biomarker. Following these recommendations, we develop and validate a multi-scale CNN model that jointly detects tissue regions and nuclei, employing pre-defined biological constraints to improve accuracy.\n\nFinally, we describe the development of a morphologic signature based on quantitative features extracted from computationally-delineated histopathologic regions and cells. This morphologic signature relies partly on a set of stromal features not captured by clinical guidelines for breast cancer grading, and has a stronger independent prognostic value.",

        "author": "Ali Ahmadvand, Emory University",
        "date": "2021-11-24",
        "description": "User intent inference is a critical step in designing intelligent information systems (e.g., conversational agents and e-commerce search engines). Accurate user intent inference improves user experience and satisfaction, but is a challenging task since user utterances or queries can be short, ambiguous, and contextually dependent. Moreover, in an e-commerce setting, the collected datasets are often labeled by weak supervision (e.g., click-through data), resulting in an imbalanced and sparse dataset. To address these problems, my dissertation proposes integrating entity knowledge-bases, conversation context, and user profile information to improve user intent inference for conversational agents. Additionally, I investigate joint learning, product taxonomies, and unlabeled domain-specific corpora (e.g., catalog) to improve query intent inference in e-commerce search.\n\nTo evaluate the proposed models, I examine the user intent inference for two main settings: 1) open-domain conversational agents and 2) e-commerce search engines. The conversational agent research is evaluated on conversations collected from real users as part of Amazon Alexa Prize competitions, and the e-commerce efforts use real query logs collected from The Home Depot's search engine. My dissertation shows that leveraging entity knowledge-base, conversation context, and user profile information accounts for most improvements for the conversational setting. The results demonstrate that the proposed models significantly enhance topic classification accuracy by 15% and dialogue act accuracy by 8% for conversational agents. For e-commerce search, the dissertation shows that joint-learning, product taxonomies, and unlabeled domain-specific corpora can significantly improve intent inference accuracy. The proposed models improve the performance of the top-1 retrieved documents by 6%-8% on standard metrics for e-commerce search. The results in both settings offer a significant improvement over state-of-the-art deep learning methods. The insights and findings in this dissertation suggest a promising direction for developing the user intent inference in both open-domain conversational agents and e-commerce search.",

        "author": "Azade Tabaie, Emory University",
        "date": "2021-11-16",
        "description": "Traditional machine learning classification algorithms assume a balanced proportion of classes in the data. However, class-imbalanced data is a challenge for training predictive models in many fields such as the medical domain. Although patient adverse outcomes occur rarely, they are worthy of prediction to improve the quality of care that patients have received; therefore, monitoring systems are needed in the hospital setting to capture the adverse rare events and improve patient health outcomes. \n  \n  To that end, machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques were used along with clinical expert knowledge to address the issue of rare event classification in a complex environment such as a hospital setting. In particular, two different patient cohort with distinct characteristics and objectives were investigated.\n  \n  First, strategies were proposed to predict a rare type of infection among hospitalized children with central venous lines (CVLs). This cohort of pediatric patients are at high risk of morbidity and mortality from hospital acquired infections. Many serious infections in hospitalized children are likely preventable through interventions that prevent the infection or identify them early to initiate antimicrobial therapy. Besides being considered as a rare clinical event, the definitions that have been proposed for bloodstream infection commonly have inadequate sensitivity for clinically important infections and may be difficult to generalize across electronic health records (EHR) platforms. To infer the onset of the infection from EHR and eliminate the need for extensive chart reviews, a surrogate definition for bloodstream infection was proposed and validated. Then, two study designs were tested to improve the prediction accuracy of the onset of the infection during hospitalization. Finally, a data fusion approach was undertaken to integrate structured and unstructured information from EHR to boost the prediction performance. Incremental but meaningful improvements in the predictions were observed after each step.\n  \n  Second, an algorithm was proposed to monitor the visits to an emergency department to detect intimate partner violence (IPV). IPV is a pervasive social challenge with severe health and demographic consequences. People experiencing IPV may seek care in emergency settings. Despite the urgency of this critical public health issue, IPV continues to be profoundly underdiagnosed and is considered a persistent hidden epidemic. IPV is frequently undercoded, undetected without appropriate screening tools, and underreported, rendering it a rare encounter in EHRs. The early and appropriate detection of and response to such cases is critical in disrupting the cycle of abuse including IPV related morbidity and mortality. Our proposed algorithm benefits from NLP techniques and domain expert knowledge. It can identify victims of IPV with a high sensitivity by analyzing the recorded provider notes and patient narratives.\n  \n  We argue that all the techniques incorporated in this thesis are transferable to identify other rare clinical events with the ultimate goal of improving the level of care.",

        "author": "Pengfei Tang, Emory University",
        "date": "2021-11-11",
        "description": "Deep learning models have been increasingly powerful on different tasks, such as image classification and data synthesization. However, there are two major vulnerabilities existing: 1) privacy leakage of the training data through inference attacks, and 2) adversarial examples that are crafted to trick the classifier to misclassify. Differential privacy (DP) is a popular technique to prevent privacy leakage, which offers a provable guarantee on privacy of training data through randomized mechanisms such as gradient perturbation. For attacks of adversarial examples, there are two categories of defense: empirical and theoretical approaches. Adversarial training is one of the most popular empirical approaches, which injects adversarial examples with correct labels to the training dataset and renders the model robust through optimization. Certified robustness is a representative of theoretical approaches, which offers a theoretical guarantee to defend against adversarial examples through randomized mechanisms such as input perturbation.  \n\nHowever, there are some limitations in existing works that reduce the effectiveness of these approaches. For DP, one challenge is the contradiction between a better utility performance and a certain level of privacy guarantee. For adversarial training, one challenge is that when the types of adversarial examples are limited, the model robustness is confined. For certified robustness, existing works fail to exploit the connection between input and gradient perturbation, which wastes a part of randomization during training. To solve these limitations, 1) we propose a novel framework IGAMT for data synthesization. Compared with traditional frameworks, IGAMT adds less gradient perturbation to guarantee DP, but still keeps the complex architecture of generative models to achieve high utility performance. 2) We propose a distance constrained Adversarial Imitation Network (AIN) for generating adversarial examples. We prove that compared with traditional adversarial training, adversarial training with examples from AIN can achieve comparable or better model robustness. 3) We propose a new framework TransDenoiser to achieve both DP and certified robustness, which utilizes all randomization during training and saves the privacy budget for DP.",

        "description": "Today's distributed systems invest significant computational and storage resources to accommodate their large scale of data, but more resources does not automatically improve performance. To deliver high performance, new types of large-scale solutions, such as the cloud computing and microservices paradigms, follow the design of deploying loosely coupled components that perform but, in the process, making it harder to maintain a global view of system performance. The ensuing growing complexity of system architectures, diagnosing and understanding performance problems has become both critically important and highly challenging. \nThe aim of my thesis is to fill in some missing but significant parts towards monitoring and analyzing performance problems in distributed system, by asking the question: What is the performance bottleneck of distributed systems performance, and how should we improve it? First, my thesis proposes a novel retroactive tracing abstraction where full telemetry information about a distributed request can be retrieved ``back in time'' soon after a problem is detected without unduly burdening any node in the system, with an always-on distributed tracing system. Second, my thesis frames the challenges of data placement in modern memory hierarchies in a generalized paging model outside of traditional assumptions, and provides an offline data placement algorithm towards optimal placement decisions. Last, my thesis derives a rule-of-thumb expression for cache warmup times, specifically how long caches in storage systems and CDNs need to be warmed up before their performance is deemed to be stable.",

Efficient automated methods that extract keywords to retrieve the salient concepts of a document are shown to be of a paramount importance in text analysis, document summarization, topic detection, and recommendation systems among others. One of the largest scientific databases, PubMed, contains more than 33 million citations and abstracts of biomedical literature to facilitate searching across several National Library of Medicine literature resources. The search results mainly depend on the effective indexing of the PubMed citations with MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) and author keywords. While indexing is enormously important in facilitating searching and clustering documents, automated software systems are still far behind human level performance. In this dissertation, we focused on the two tasks of indexing PubMed citations with keywords and MeSH terms. To that end, we proposed 1) an unsupervised extraction method based on phrase-embedding and modified PageRank algorithm which converges faster and performs better than related baseline methods; 2) A Sequence tagging deep learning method based on attending to words that are central to the document’s semantics; 3) A semi-supervised deep learning approach to harness vastly available unannotated biomedical data that improves keyword extraction based on uncertainty estimation. 4) A reinforcement Learning-based encoder-decoder method for MeSH indexing.",

        "description": "Navigating spaces is an embodied experience. Examples can vary from rescue \nworkers trying to save people from natural disasters, tourists finding their way \nto the nearest coffee shop, or a person solving a maze. Virtual reality can \nallow these experiences to simulate in a controlled virtual environment. \nHowever, virtual reality users remain anchored in the real world and the \nconventions by which the virtual environment gets deployed influence user \nperformance. There is currently a need to evaluate the degree of influence \nimposed by extrinsic factors and virtual reality hardware on its users. \nTraditionally, immersive virtual reality experiences uses Head-Mounted Displays \nwith powerful computers rendering the virtual environment's graphical content. \nHowever, user input has been facilitated using various human interface devices, \nincluding Keyboards, Mice, Trackballs, Touchscreens, Joysticks, Gamepads, Motion \ndetecting cameras, and Webcams. Some of these HIDs have also been introduced for \nnon-immersive video games and general computing. Thus, a subset of virtual \nreality users has greater familiarity than others in using these HIDs. Virtual \nreality experiences that utilize gamepads (controllers) to navigate virtual \nenvironments may introduce a bias towards usability among virtual reality users \npreviously exposed to video gaming. For widespread adoption, we must offer \ngeneralizable interaction paradigms to users of all shapes and forms, including \nvideo-gamers, non-video-gamers, and everyone else. To establish universality, \nthe field must first understand the different ways users engage and perceive \nvirtual spaces.\n \nIn this talk, we will be observing an evaluative user study conducted using \nour ubiquitous virtual reality framework with general audiences.

        "description": "Machine learning has achieved many big innovations in all industries and significantly impacted our daily lives. However, machine learning can also result in severe security and privacy risks. In this talk, I will present our recent works on both theory and applications that fundamentally contribute to machine learning security and privacy. First, we designed the first differential privacy mechanism (R2DP) that universally optimizes the randomization for the maximum utility w.r.t. any utility metric. It fundamentally improves the utility of differential privacy mechanisms in all the relevant applications, such as statistical queries, classification, social network analysis, and deep learning.   Second, we propose the first black-box attack framework that generates universal 3-dimensional (U3D) perturbations to subvert a wide variety of video deep neural networks (DNNs). The new attack is easy-to-launch, universal, transferable, and human-imperceptible. It can also bypass the state-of-the-art defense methods.  Such novel attack motivates the video recognition systems to build and integrate more robust DNN models. \nBiography:\nYuan Hong is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Cybersecurity Program Director at Illinois Institute of Technology.

        "author": "Mani Sotoodeh, Emory University",
        "date": "2021-07-27",
        "description": "Pressure ulcer injury (PUI) or bedsore is “a localized injury to the skin and/or underlying tissue due to pressure.” More than 2.5 million Americans develop PUI annually, and the incidence of hospital-acquired PUI (HAPUI) is around 5% to 6%. Bedsores are correlated with reduced quality of life, higher mortality and readmission rates, and longer hospital stays. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid considers PUI as the most frequent preventable event, and PUIs are the 2nd most common claim in lawsuits. The current practice of manual quarterly assessments for a day to estimate PUI rates has many disadvantages including high cost, subjectivity, and substantial disagreement among nurses, not to mention missed opportunities to alter practices to improve care instantly. The biggest challenge in HAPUI detection using EHRs is assigning ground truth for HAPUI classification, which requires consideration of multiple clinical criteria from nursing guidelines. However, these criteria do not explicitly map to EHRs data sources. Furthermore, there is no consistent cohort definition among research works tackling HAPUI detection. As labels significantly impact the model’s performance, inconsistent labels complicate the comparison of research works. Multiple opinions for the same HAPUI classification task can remedy this uncertainty in labeling. Research works on learning with multiple uncertain labels are mainly developed for computer vision. Unfortunately, however, acquiring images from PUIs at hospitals is not standard practice, and we have to resort to tabular or time-series data. Finally, acquiring expert nursing annotations for establishing accurate labels is costly. Though if unlabelled samples can be utilized, a combination of annotated and unlabelled samples could yield a robust classifier. To overcome these challenges, we achieved the following: 1) Proposing a new standardized HAPUI cohort definition applicable to EHR data loyal to clinical guidelines; 2) Introducing a novel model for learning with unreliable crowdsourcing labels using sample-specific perturbations, suitable for sparse annotations of HAPUI detection (CrowdTeacher); 3) Exploring unstructured notes for CrowdTeacher enhancement and gleaning better feature representations for HAPUI detection; 4) Incorporating unlabelled data into HAPUI detection via semi-supervised learning to reduce annotation costs",

        "description": "Modern healthcare systems are collecting a huge volume of healthcare data from a large number of individuals with various medical procedures, medications, diagnosis, lab tests and so on. Tensor factorization has been demonstrated as an efficient approach for computational phenotyping, where massive electronic health records (EHRs) are converted to concise and meaningful clinical concepts. However, the EHR data is also fragmented and is always distributed among independent medical institutions, and they are prohibited from being shared and exchanged. Recently, federated learning offers a paradigm for collaborative learning among different entities, which seemingly provides an ideal potential to further enhance the tensor factorization-based collaborative phenotyping to handle sensitive personal health data. This poses challenges to preserving the privacy of the exchanged intermediary results in order to protect the sensitive patient information. Meanwhile, efforts still need to be made to overcome the limitations of the federated tensor factorization, including the restrictions to the classic tensor factorization, high communication cost and reduced accuracy. Furthermore, it is essential to develop the decentralization techniques for federated tensor factorization to deal with the vulnerability of the central server to malfunction and external attacks. To deal with these challenging problems, we propose 1) a privacy-preserving collaborative tensor factorization method for computational phenotyping which is able to deal with heterogeneous data with rigorous privacy guarantee and achieves less communication cost and comparable accuracy; 2) a communication efficient federated generalized tensor factorization, which is flexible enough to choose from a variate of losses to best suit different types of data in practice; 3) a communication efficient decentralized generalized tensor factorization method which enables the absence of the central server and further reduces the communication cost.",

        "description": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have revolutionized biological research, and cell clustering becomes an important and commonly performed task in scRNA-seq data analysis. An essential step in scRNA-seq clustering is to select a subset of genes (referred to as “features”), whose expression patterns will further be adopted for downstream clustering analysis. It is noting that both the quality and quantity of the feature set will have significant impact on the clustering accuracy. However, almost all existing scRNA-seq clustering tools select features relying on some simple unsupervised methods, mostly based on statistical moments. Plus, these existing tools tend to choose random top (e.g., 1000 or 2000) features for cell clustering. In this talk, I will present a novel unsupervised algorithm named FEAST (Su et al., 2021) specifically designed for selecting most representative genes in scRNA-seq data before performing the core of clustering. Another common and practical question in the scRNA-seq experiment is how to decide a proper number of cells in order to reach a desired power level, in the context of differential expression tests and marker gene detections. I will also present POWSC pipeline (Su et al., 2020), a simulation-based approach, to provide comprehensive power evaluation and sample size recommendation.

        "description": "This dissertation addresses challenges in learning to predict time-to-event outcomes such as survival and treatment response from high dimension data including whole slide images and genomic profiles that are being produced in modern pathology labs. Learning from these data requires integration of disparate data types, and the ability to attend to important signals within vast amounts of irrelevant data present in each sample. Furthermore, clinical translation of machine learning models for prognostication requires communicating the degree and types of uncertainty to clinical end users who will rely on inferences from these models.\n\nThis dissertation has addressed these challenges. To validate our developed data fusion technique, we have selected cancer histology data as it reflects underlying molecular processes and disease progression and contains rich phenotypic information predictive of patient outcomes. This study shows a computational approach for learning patient outcomes from digital pathology images using deep learning to combine the power of adaptive machine learning algorithms with survival models. We illustrate how these survival convolutional neural networks (SCNNs) can integrate information from both histology images and genomic biomarkers into a single unified framework to predict time-to-event outcomes and show prediction accuracy that surpasses the current clinical paradigm for predicting the overall survival of patients diagnosed with glioma. Next, to capture the volume of data and manage heterogeneity within the histology images, we have developed GestAltNet, which emulates human attention to high-yield areas and aggregation across regions. GestAltNet points toward a future of genuinely whole slide digital pathology by incorporating human-like behaviors of attention and gestalt formation process across massive whole slide images. We have used GestAltNet to estimate the gestational age from whole slide images of placental tissues and compared this to networks lacking attention and aggregation capabilities. To address the challenge of representing uncertainty during inference, we have developed a Bayesian survival neural network that captures the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties when predicting clinical outcomes. These networks are the next generation of machine learning models for predicting time-to-event outcomes, where the degree and source of uncertainty are communicated to clinical end users",

        "date": "2021-03-30",
        "description": "Crowd-based computing can be described in a way that distributes tasks among multiple individuals or organizations to interact with their intelligent or computing devices. Two of the exciting classes of crowd-based computing are crowdsourcing and federated learning, where the first one is crowd-based data collection, and the second one is crowd-based model learning. Crowdsourcing is a paradigm that provides a cost-effective solution for obtaining services or data from a large group of users. It has been increasingly used in modern society for data collection in various domains such as image annotation or real-time traffic reports. Although crowdsourcing is a cost-effective solution, it is an easy target to take advantage of by assembling great numbers of users to artificially boost support for organizations, products, or even opinions. Therefore, deciding to use the best aggregation method that tackles attacks in such applications is one of the main challenges in developing an effective crowdsourcing system. Moreover, the original aggregation algorithm in federated learning is susceptible to data poisoning attacks. Also, the dynamic behavior of this framework in terms of choosing clients randomly in each iteration poses further challenges for implementing the robust aggregating method in federated learning. In this dissertation, we devise strategies that improve the system’s robustness under data poisoning attacks when workers intentionally or strategically misbehave. \n https://zoom.us/j/9828106847",

        "description": "To defeat the current COVID-19 pandemic, a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine has emerged as a promising approach thanks to its rapid and scalable production and non-infectious and non-integrating properties. However, designing an mRNA sequence to achieve high stability and protein yield remains a challenging problem due to the exponentially large search space (e.g., there are $2.4 \\times 10^{632}$ possible mRNA sequence candidates for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2). We describe two on-going efforts for this problem, both using linear-time algorithms inspired by my earlier work in natural language parsing. On one hand, the Eterna OpenVaccine project from Stanford Medical School takes a crowd-sourcing approach to let game players all over the world design stable sequences. To evaluate sequence stability (in terms of free energy), they use LinearFold from my group (2019) since it’s the only linear-time RNA folding algorithm available (which makes it the only one fast enough for COVID-scale genomes). On the other hand, we take a computational approach to directly search for the optimal sequence in this exponentially large space via dynamic programming. It turns out this problem can be reduced to a classical problem in formal language theory and computational linguistics (intersection between CFG and DFA), which can be solved in $O(n^3)$ time, just like lattice parsing for speech. In the end, we can design the optimal mRNA vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in just about 10 minutes.  To conclude, classical results (dating back to 1960s) from theoretical computer science and mathematical linguistics helped us solve the very challenging and extremely important problem in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\\\\\n\nBio:  Liang Huang (PhD, Penn, 2008) is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Oregon State University and Distinguished Scientist at Baidu Research USA.

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, he has shifted his attention to the fight against the virus, which resulted in efficient algorithms for stable mRNA vaccine design, adapted from classical theory and algorithms from mathematical linguistics dating back to the 1960s.",

These neural ODEs in which the ODE dynamics are defined by neural network components, benefit from reduced parameterization and smoother hidden states than traditional discrete neural networks but come at high computational costs. Training a neural ODE can be phrased as an ODE-constrained optimization problem, which allows for the application of mathematical optimal control (OC). The application of OC theory leads to design choices that differ from popular high-cost implementations.

        "description": "Machine translation uses machine learning to automatically translate text from one language to another and has the potential to reduce language barriers. Recent improvements in machine translation have made it more widely-usable, partly due to deep neural network approaches. However—like most deep learning algorithms—neural machine translation is sensitive to the quantity and quality\nof training data, and therefore produces poor translations for some languages and styles of text. Machine translation training data typically comes in the form of parallel text—sentences translated between the two languages of interest. Limited quantities of parallel text are available for most language pairs, leading to a low-resource problem.  Even when training data is available in the desired language pair, it is frequently formal text—leading to a domain mismatch when models are used to translate a different type of data, such as social media or medical text.  Neural machine translation currently performs poorly in low-resource and domain mismatch settings; my work aims to overcome these limitations, and make machine translation a useful tool for all users.  In this talk, I will discuss a method for improving translation in low resource settings—Simulated Multiple Reference Training (SMRT; Khayrallah et al., 2020)—which uses a paraphraser to simulate training on all possible translations per sentence. I will also discuss work on improving domain adaptation (Khayrallah et al., 2018), and work on analyzing the effect of noisy training data (Khayrallah and Koehn, 2018).",

        "description": "The digital transformation has given rise to a new form of science driven by data. Graphs (or networks) are a powerful framework for the solution of data science problems, especially when the goal is to extract knowledge from and make predictions about the dynamics of complex systems such as those arising from epidemiology, social media and infrastructure. However, this representation power comes at a cost, as graphs are highly combinatorial structures, leading to challenges in search, optimization, and learning tasks that are relevant to modern real-world applications.   In this talk, I will overview my recent work on new algorithms and models\nfor mining and learning from graph data. First, I will show how the interplay between graph structure and its dynamics can be exploited for pattern mining and inference in networked processes, such as improving the effectiveness of testing during a pandemic. Then, I will focus on machine learning on graphs, where novel deep learning and optimization approaches for predicting graph data, such as traffic forecasting, will be described. As the last topic, I will introduce combinatorial algorithms for optimization on graphs that enable us to attack/defend their core structure, among other applications. I will end by briefly contextualizing my ongoing work as part of a broader research agenda with new related problems that I plan to address in the next few years.",

However, there still remains a large gap between the decision-making capabilities of humans and machines. In this talk, I will investigate two factors to explain why. First, I will discuss the presence of undesirable biases in datasets, which ultimately hurt generalization, regardless of dataset size. I will then present bias mitigation algorithms that boost the ability of AI models to generalize to unseen data. Second, I will explore task-specific prior knowledge which aid robust generalization, but are often ignored when training modern AI architectures on large amounts of data. In particular, I will show how linguistic structure can provide useful biases for inferring shallow semantics, which help in natural language understanding. I will conclude with a discussion of how this framework of dataset and model biases could play a critical role even in the societal impact of AI, going forward.",

In the first part of my talk, I will\npresent my work on evaluating the long-term impact of (fair) ML decisions\non population groups that are repeatedly subject to such decisions.

        "description": "Classification algorithms build models that can classify new observations. While they require a training set of samples' features and labels for training, in reality, many unstructured datasets do not meet the requirement. Since having experts to give out manual labels has a high cost, many industries adopted crowdsourcing, which enables a group of people to contribute to the same labeling task. However, multiple annotations cannot apply to classification algorithms because they assume that labels are single and consensus. In this paper, we use truth inference methods to estimate single labels given different annotations from multiple annotators. While the Expectation-Maximization method provides the best accuracy, our empirical results suggest that better predictive performance can be achieved by accounting for disagreements. Thus, we propose Medaboost, a new predictive model, that considers the degree of disagreements between annotators to improve predictive performance. Medaboost outperforms AdaBoost on both synthetic dataset and MIMIC-III dataset under different sets of simulated nurses’.",

        "description": "A Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) is an appealing network architecture for low-cost and wide geographical coverage. It serves as a potential alternative solution to improve worldwide connectivity in low to high-income countries. Theoretical studies predict, however, insufficient capacity for such network architecture at larger scales. Moreover, the inherently distributed nature of WMNs and their typical distributed network control mechanisms turned them hardened and inflexible to adapt to specific and varying control customization demands.\nWe propose the modernization of the WMN architecture by allowing the general applicability of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) on the implementation of WMN control planes for increased control flexibility while also enforcing frequency diversity to promote throughput capacity. To achieve this, we devised autonomic agents that induce the formation of WMN topologies as a set of interconnected partitions, supporting a cooperative, multi-domain SDN-based WMN control plane able to operate at large-scales and low-cost for increased control flexibility. Moreover, the nature of this autonomic network based on WMN partitions also allows the enforcement of frequency diversity at low-cost and low-complexity for improved throughput capacity. The partitioned topology format is the result of the concurrent and distributed operation of our autonomic agents that manipulate the formation of the WMN using local information, without relying on any central controlling entity, characterizing a scalable and resilient solution. Partitions hold as invariants their maximum diameter and their maximum per node interface degree. These two induce an additional invariant: the maximum partition size in mesh nodes. Finally, the three properties permit limiting control latency and workload on SDN control plane domains. Our agents have different objectives such as organize, heal, optimize; thus, they cooperate and compete to determine final WMN topologies. We show that the competitive/cooperative behavior of these agents converge to stable formations in bounded time even under extreme mesh node churn conditions. The solution relies on an in-network leader election and stochastic delays to achieve the eventual stabilization of formed WMN topologies.\"",

I will present models for variants of this system and derive expressions for switch capacity and the expected number of qubits stored in memory at the switch. Much of this work focuses on bipartite entanglement switching. For this case, I will discuss how performance metrics are affected by decoherence and link heterogeneity. In this talk, I will also discuss a work wherein we explore a set of switching policies for a switch that can serve both bipartite and tripartite entangled states.

Its content ranges from great reference sources such as Wikipedia to ugly fake news. Indeed, social (digital) media is just an amplifying mirror of ourselves. Hence, the main challenge of search engines and other websites that rely on web data is to assess the quality of such data. However, as all people has their own biases, web content as well as our web interactions are tainted with many biases. Data bias includes redundancy and spam, while interaction bias includes activity and presentation bias. In addition, sometimes algorithms add bias, particularly in the context of search and recommendation systems. As bias generates bias, we stress the importance of debiasing data as well as using the context and other techniques such as explore & exploit, to break the filter bubble. The main goal of this talk is to make people aware of the different biases that affect all of us on the Web. Awareness is the first step to be able to fight and reduce the vicious cycle of web bias.

My research introduces computational methods and systems to understand and design defenses against such problematic online content. In this talk, I will focus on three aspects of problematic online information: 1) non-credible content, 2) conspiracy theories, and 3) extremist propaganda. First, I will present the development and analysis of a large-scale, systematic social media credibility corpus, called CREDBANK. With CREDBANK's 66M tweets nested in 1,377 real-world events, I will show that temporal and linguistic regularities can differentiate credible and non-credible information.

Third, I will dive into a special type of problematic content: narratives of extremists hate groups. Merging framing theory from social movement research with big data analyses, I will discuss the ecosystem of cross-platform communication by hate groups. Finally, I will close by previewing important new opportunities I see my lab tackling in the next few years to address some of these problems, including conducting social audits to defend against algorithmically generated misinformation and designing socio-technical interventions and systems to promote online tolerance, civility, and trust.",

Among the various aspects of network studies, network connectivity is the one that plays a foundational role in a myriad of tasks (e.g. information dissemination, robustness analysis, and community detection).\nIn this talk, I will present my research about the connectivity measures, inference and optimization problems in complex networks.

Most of them are unconditioned generative models which has no control on modes of the graphs being generated. Going beyond that, in this presentation, I will talk about a new topic named Deep Graph Transformation: given a source graph, we want to infer a target graph based on their underlying global and local transformation mapping. By automatically interpreting such generative transformation process, we aim to distill new rules and patterns of the underlying transformation mechanism. Deep graph transformation could be highly desirable in many promising applications on network synthesis and prediction, such as chemical reaction simulation, brain network modeling, and protein structure prediction. I will introduce our recent progress on new structured learning frameworks, convolution and deconvolution operations, and intepretability enhancement techniques for deep graph transformation.

Many research challenges remain that are critical for safe deployment of ML methods for clinical decision support. One of these challenges is related to the ability of ML models to learn clinically relevant and actionable insights. In the first part of my talk I focus on contextualizing these concerns in terms of explainability of ML methods and the widening discrepancy between current ML explainability research and clinician expectations. One such severely understudied problem is determining the individualized feature relevance in time series models. We propose a method to quantify feature importance in this setting by leveraging deep generative models and demonstrate its efficacy on simulated and real world data. While disparities in healthcare have been well documented, the effect of using biased data in ML, especially for causal effect estimation, needs more scrutiny. To that effect, in the second part of my talk, I will describe a method we propose to evaluate the reliability of state of the art ML based counterfactual regression models in the presence of treatment and outcome disparity and relating their efficacy to underlying data generative settings and awareness of the source of disparity.

For some tasks, such as predicting complex events like recessions or global conflicts, human input remains a crucial component, either in a standalone capacity or as a complement to algorithms and statistical models. In other cases, a decision maker is tasked with utilizing human preferences to, for example, make a popular decision over an unpopular one. However, while often useful, eliciting data from humans poses significant challenges. First, humans are strategic, and may misrepresent their private information if doing so can benefit them. Second, when decisions affect humans, we often want outcomes to be fair, not systematically favoring one individual or group over another.\n\nIn this talk, I discuss two settings that exemplify these considerations. First, I consider the participatory budgeting problem in which a shared budget must be divided among competing public projects. Building on classic literature in economics, I present a class of truthful mechanisms and exhibit a tradeoff between fairness and economic efficiency within this class. Second, I examine the classic online learning problem of learning with expert advice in a setting where experts are strategic and act to maximize their influence on the learner.

        "description": "Methods for managing dynamic systems typically invoke one of two perspectives. In the worst-case perspective, the system is assumed to behave in the worst possible way; this perspective is used to provide formal safety guarantees. In the risk-neutral perspective, the system is assumed to behave as expected; this perspective is invoked in reinforcement learning and stochastic optimal control. While the worst-case perspective is useful for safety analysis, it can lead to unnecessarily conservative decisions, especially in settings where uncertainties are non-adversarial. The risk-neutral perspective is less conservative and useful for optimizing the system’s performance on average. However, optimizing average performance is not guaranteed to protect against harmful outcomes and thus is not appropriate for safety-critical applications. In this talk, I will first present an analytical and data-driven computational toolkit for managing triple-negative breast cancer that I have developed with cancer biologists at Oregon Health and Science University by invoking the worst-case perspective. In addition to providing biological insights about breast cancer and theoretical insights about switched systems, this work has motivated the need for new mathematical methods that facilitate less conservative but still protective control of dynamic systems. Towards this aim, I have devised a risk-sensitive mathematical method for safety analysis that blends the worst-case and risk-neutral perspectives by leveraging the Conditional Value-at-Risk measure. The next part of my talk will focus on this new risk-sensitive mathematical method and its application to evaluating safety of urban water infrastructure in joint work with water resources specialists at the Berkeley Water Center and Tufts University. In the last part of my talk, I will present the aims of my future research program “Decision Analysis for Trustworthy Autonomy” that will extend the theories of control, risk, and learning to address safety-critical challenges in society.\n\nBio: Margaret Chapman is a PhD Candidate advised by Dr. Claire Tomlin in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) at UC Berkeley.

How should these scarce resources be allocated? Any approach to this question requires insights from computer science, economics, and beyond; we must define objectives (foregrounding equity and distributive justice in addition to efficiency), predict outcomes (taking causal considerations into account), and optimize allocations, while carefully considering agent preferences and incentives. \nIn this talk, I will discuss our work on weighted matching and assignment in two domains, namely living donor kidney transplantation and provision of services to homeless households. My focus will be on how effective prediction of the outcomes of matches has the potential to dramatically improve social welfare both by allowing for richer mechanisms and by improving allocations.",

        "date": "2020-01-24",
        "description": "Statistical relational models are widely used in network science to reason about the properties of complex systems — where the nodes represent entities (e.g., individuals, disease vectors, patients etc.) and the links represent relationships (e.g., friendship, contagion paths, bio- and social-markers, etc.). A type of relational models is generative network models that aim to capture the observed characteristics of real world networks to reproduce them via sampling. To acquire a better understanding of the underlying properties of the system (e.g., a social network), many challenges must be overcome. An example of these challenges is that a good descriptive model of networks not always facilitate sampling. In order to overcome this challenge, it is important to develop relational models that facilitate sampling methods for networks with and without vertex-attributes. However, this task remains a challenging problem because most current methods work with relatively simple or specific models. Another challenge is to understand the dynamics that appear in a complex system and how these dynamics evolve and what are the dependencies across components of the system that drive these dynamics.\nIn my talk, I will discuss some developments for these two types of problems starting with an application to health informatics. First, nowadays, the popularity of machine learning has produced a significant body of research on social and medical sciences. In my work, I have developed mathematical descriptions of health and wellness of the individuals.  I investigated various techniques of network science to extract the graph-theoretic bio-markers. Also, I applied machine learning to predict stress and wellness variables. With my colleagues, we showed how to use these additional biomarkers to improve the accuracy of prediction of wellness of individuals. I will present a few other examples where I apply some methodological insights acquired from relational learning. Second, I will present observations about a number of recent models that share a common structure. This structure allows to increase both the variance of the models and the space of characteristics possible to be modeled. Building on these results I will discuss general strategies to combine models and density functions of the node attributes to sample attributed-networks. Since in this structure the probability mass is allocated to certain regions of the network space it is hard to identify candidate networks to sample attributed networks. I will present constrained sampling to bias the search of edge-candidates using the topological space with higher likelihood. \nFinally, identifying the laws that govern a complex system based on its network representation is an open problem.  In my work, I identified strategies to represent changes in a dynamical system using its footprint data. The persistent challenge is that most approaches for incident detection in complex non-linear systems use nominal systems that rely on domain expertise. With my colleagues, we have studied the problem of incident detection in non-linear systems using the trajectory of the causal relationships described only by the time-series data.",

Nevertheless, many fundamental questions remain, and it is important to develop a proper theoretical understanding of machine learning to guide its future development. In this talk I will discuss the fundamental properties of optimization, sampling, and games for machine learning. In optimization, I will present a variational perspective on accelerated methods via the principle of least action in continuous time, and derive new families of higher-order and rescaled accelerated methods which achieve faster convergence under more refined smoothness conditions. In sampling, I will present a study of sampling as optimization in the space of measures, and show fast convergence of Langevin algorithms for sampling under isoperimetry conditions which extend classical log-concavity results. In games, I will present an analysis of minimax game dynamics as skew-optimization in the space of joint configurations, and show fast convergence of the classical fictitious play algorithm and its optimistic variant under smoothness.\n\nBio: Andre Wibisono is a postdoctoral researcher in the School of Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

The advent of remote sensing, distributed intelligence and networking offers additional opportunities to improve system's operation and flexibility against mounting uncertainties. We focus on understanding inherit system’s vulnerabilities and the foundational trade-offs between optimality, autonomy and reliability. Resilience is an essential enabler for continued innovation, however, existing solutions follow a bottom-up technology-focused approach that may not sufficiently address risks across the different operational layers.\n \nIn this talk, we expand on the benefits of multi-agent cyber-physical modeling to 1) facilitate a better understanding of exiting complexities, and 2) establish a framework to help design new approaches for efficient, adaptive, resilient and secure-by-design solutions. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we combine elements from system dynamics, distributed resources and sensing, communication and control to enhance the ability of the system to absorb and withstand cyber-physical disturbances.\n \nWe elaborate on how cyber-physical disturbances induce an amount of uncertainty that is better captured using a risk-based model, where a properly defined and quantified risk metric can be used as a parameter for operation. Finally, we outline future studies expanding on the need for data-driven trust models, risk assessment approaches, contextual anomaly detection, and extending approaches into other multi-agent cyber-physical systems.",

Many technical challenges remain that are critical for safe deployment of ML methods for clinical decision support. One of these challenges is related to the ability of ML models to learn clinically relevant and actionable insights. In the first part of my talk I focus on contextualizing these concerns in terms of explainability of ML methods and the widening discrepancy between current ML explainability research and clinician expectations. One such severely understudied problem is determining the individualized feature relevance in time series models. We propose a method to quantify feature importance in this setting by leveraging deep generative models and demonstrate its efficacy on simulated and real world data. While disparities in healthcare have been well documented, the effect of using biased data in ML, especially for causal effect estimation, needs more scrutiny. To that effect, in the second part of my talk, I will describe a method we propose to evaluate the reliability of state of the art ML based counterfactual regression models in the presence of treatment and outcome disparity and relating their efficacy to underlying data generative settings and awareness of the source of disparity.

        "description": "NLP in Medicine: annotation & prediction\nThe lack of labelled data creates a data “bottleneck” for developing deep learning models for medical\nimaging. However, healthcare institutions have millions of imaging studies which are associated with\nunstructured free text radiology reports that describe imaging features and diagnoses, but there are no\nreliable methods for leveraging these reports to create structured labels for training deep learning\nmodels. Unstructured free text thwarts machine understanding, due to the ambiguity and variations in\nlanguage among radiologists and healthcare organizations. Thus, most of existing AI applications in\nmedicine, starting from diagnosis to prediction of treatment outcomes, largely excluded free-text\nnarratives which are one of the richest component of EMR.\n\nMy talk will first describe recent developments of semantic word embedding methods to leverage\nnarrative reports associated with radiological scans to generate automatically rich labels for training deep\nlearning models and will highlight its application to difference domains of radiology (CT, MR, US,\nmammograms). I will also present recent deep learning projects that push beyond image classification\nand tackle the challenging problem of clinical outcome (e.g. progression and survival) prediction with\nlongitudinal visit data, including images and free-text notes. The talk will briefly cover techniques for\n“peering inside the deep learning black box” to better understand what a deep learning model has learned\nfor the task of making predications from longitudinal patient data. This direction of using longitudinal\nunstructured visit data will open a novel pathway for developing many advanced AI-based decision\nsupport systems that will leverage the unstructured information from medical “Big Data” to assist patient\nmanagement.\n\nLeveraging language-based social media data for impactful health research\nLarge amounts of health-related knowledge are encapsulated within predominantly text-based social media data. The characteristics of the data from this resource present unique challenges to mining. These characteristics include, but are not limited to, noise, data imbalance, redundancy, and ambiguity. Utilizing social media for health applications requires the development of customized, end-to-end data processing pipelines, which typically involve combinations of rule-based and learning-based modules. There is also the strong need to develop simple and easily-deployable systems to empower the real end users--medical experts. In this talk, I will present the key considerations required to convert noisy text-based social media big data into valuable knowledge that can be used by medical domain experts. I will discuss some of the exciting existing projects and future plans in this space, and the possible opportunities for students with computer science backgrounds.",

        "description": "In recent years, computational psychiatry has emerged as a field that combines multiple levels and types of data and computational modeling to improve understanding, prediction, and treatment of mental illness.\n\nMental health patients often undergo a variety of non-invasive (e.g., cognitive counseling) and invasive (e.g., surgery) therapies before finding an effective treatment plan. Improved prediction of treatment response can shorten the duration of clinical trials and improve patient experience and outcomes. A key challenge of applying predictive modeling to this problem is that often, the effectiveness of a treatment regimen remains unknown for several weeks. \n\nIn this thesis, we propose Machine Learning approaches to extracting audio-visual features for predicting the likely outcome of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) treatment several weeks in advance for patients suffering from major depressive disorder, a common psychiatric illness for which there are no objective, non-verbal, automated markers that can reliably track treatment response. \nWe first explore the use of video analysis of facial expressivity in a cohort of severely depressed patients before and after DBS. We introduce a set of variability measurements to obtain unsupervised features from muted video recordings. We then, leverage the link between short-term emotions and long-term depressed mood states and use a neural network model on the top of emotion-based audio features.\n\nThe results show that unsupervised features extracted from these audio and video recordings, when incorporated in classification models, can discriminate different levels of depression severity during ongoing DBS treatment. Moreover, for the long term prediction and in the absence of immediate treatment-response feedback, we utilize a joint state-estimation and temporal difference learning approach to model both the trajectory of a patient's response and the delayed nature of feedbacks using deep neural networks. \n\nOur findings suggest that Machine Learning models can discover objective biomarkers of depression and patient response to treatments, which have the potential to standardize treatment protocols and enhance the design of future clinical trials.",

Biological events are inherently multidimensional, and they occur at different timescales, frequencies, and resolutions. Yet, for many years, the limitations of digital imaging technologies have prevented researchers from gaining a holistic view of their problem. The goal of modern bioimage informatics is to leverage knowledge in big data, computer vision, and machine learning to efficiently and effectively process high-dimensional data sets. Although many open-source algorithms are available for processing bioimages, advanced numerical methods are still needed for handling big spectral, volumetric, and temporal data. In this talk, we will discuss novel contributions to the areas of spectral unmixing, volumetric reconstruction, and video-based tracking. Specifically, we will present (1) a robust algorithm for unmixing large numbers of fluorescent labels from contaminated spectral micrographs; (2) an offline/online multiresolution workflow for the reconstruction of three-dimensional subvolumes of interest from serial gigapixel whole slide images; and (3) an automated analysis pipeline and graphical interface to aid in situ tracking of insect movement that uses low-cost, human-readable tags.",

        "description": "Since the emergence of high throughput  experiments such as Next Generation Sequencing, the volume of genomic data produced has been increasing exponentially. This data holds the key to accurate predictions of clinical outcomes and mapping patients to the optimal treatment. However, analyzing genomic data is challenged by its high-dimensionality. Many prediction methods face limitations in learning from high-dimensional data generated by these platforms, and rely on experts to hand-select a small number of features for training prediction models. In this thesis, we demonstrate how the latest advances in neural networks methods that have been remarkably successful in general high-dimensional prediction tasks can be leveraged to the problem of predicting cancer outcomes. We perform an extensive comparison of deep survival models and other state of the art machine learning methods for survival analysis. We appreciate that interpretability is of great importance in adapting neural networks in bioinformatics, and propose a framework for interpreting deep survival models using a risk back-propagation technique that can lead to new understanding of diseases. Finally, we illustrate that deep survival models can successfully transfer information across heterogeneous data sources to improve prognostic accuracy, and describe an adversarial multi-task learning approach that outperforms traditional multi-task learning methods. We provide an open-source software implementation of these frameworks that enables automatic training, evaluation and interpretation of deep survival models.",

How can we help people understand complex machine learning models, so that they can learn them more easily and use them more effectively?\nIn this talk, I present my research that makes AI more accessible and interpretable, through a novel human-centered approach, by creating novel data visualization tools that are scalable,  interactive, and easy to learn and to use. I present my work in two interrelated topics. (1) Visualization for Industry-scale Models: I present how to scale up interactive visualization tools for industry-scale deep learning models that use large datasets. I describe how the ActiVis system helps Facebook data scientists interpret deep neural network models by visually exploring activation flows. ActiVis is patent-pending, and has been deployed on Facebook's ML platform. (2) Interactive Understanding of Complex Models: I show how visualization helps novices interactively learn complex concepts of deep learning models. I describe how I developed GAN Lab, a visual education system for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), one of the most popular, but hard-to-understand models. GAN Lab has been open-sourced in collaboration with Google Brain and used by over 30,000 people from 140 countries.

We find that challenges, such as a fear of negative feedback and intimidating community size, can dissuade programmers, especially novices and women, from participating in the community and forging on to become experienced contributors. To determine how to increase participation, we apply theory from a guided mentorship. In our approach, we find that mentored questions are substantially improved over non-mentored questions, with average scores increasing by 50%. These results suggest how we can challenge socio-technical communities to use identity as mechanism to increase participation.",

My works employ relational modeling of political social networks in combination with these abstractions to accurately predict and classify the ideological stances, policy frames, and moral foundations present in tweets.

For NLU, we often need computational models that involve multiple interdependent learners, along with significant levels of composition and reasoning based on additional knowledge beyond available data. NLU requires pragmatics and common sense reasoning on top of syntactic and semantic information. Conventional programming paradigms offer no help in developing such complex learning-based models. In this talk, I discuss two themes of my research. One theme is the declarative learning-based programming (DeLBP) paradigm that aims at facilitating the design and development of complex intelligent systems. The other theme is an important NLU problem of spatial language understanding. Spatial language conveys the information about the location/translocation of objects and their spatial relationships. This semantics is relevant for visualization and grounding language into the real-world. I demonstrate how DeLBP framework facilitates working with structured data from heterogeneous resources (vision and language), considering domain knowledge and spatial ontologies in learning, and designing various learning and inference configurations. This paradigm helps to move towards integrating learning and reasoning and exploiting both symbolic and sub-symbolic representations for solving complex and AI-complete tasks.",

In this talk, I will discuss deep learning techniques for performing this semantic mapping from raw, unstructured, human natural language directly to a structured, relational database, without any intermediate pre-processing steps or string matching heuristics. Specifically, I show that a novel, end-to-end convolutional neural architecture successfully learns a shared latent space, where vector representations of natural language queries lie close to embeddings of database entries that have semantically similar meanings. Thus, the learned semantic embeddings of database entries are used to map directly from an embedded user query to the most similar database matches.

        "date": "2018-05-16",
        "description": "Nonlinear inverse problems arise in numerous imaging applications, and solving them is often difficult due to ill-posedness and high computational cost. In this work, we introduce tailored solvers for several nonlinear inverse problems in imaging within a Gauss-Newton optimization framework.\\\\\n\\\\\nWe develop a linearize and project (LAP) method for a class of nonlinear problems with two (or more) sets of coupled variables. At each iteration of the Gauss-Newton optimization, LAP linearizes the residual around the current iterate, eliminates one block of variables via a projection, and solves the resulting reduced dimensional problem for the Gauss-Newton step. The method is best suited for problems where the subproblem associated with one set of variables is comparatively well-posed or easy to solve. LAP supports iterative, direct, and hybrid regularization and supports element-wise bound constraints on all the blocks of variables. This offers various options for incorporating prior knowledge of a desired solution. We demonstrate the advantages of these characteristics with several numerical experiments. We test LAP for two and three dimensional problems in super resolution and MRI motion correction, two separable nonlinear least squares problems that are linear in one block of variables and nonlinear in the other. We also use LAP for image registration subject to local rigidity constraints, a problem that is nonlinear in all sets of variables. These two classes of problems demonstrate the utility and flexibility LAP method.\\\\\n\\\\\nWe also implement an efficient Gauss-Newton optimization scheme for the problem of phase recovery in bispectral imaging, a univariate nonlinear inverse problem. Using a fixed approximate Hessian, matrix-reordering, and stored matrix factors, we accelerate the Gauss-Newton step solve, resulting in a second-order optimization method which outperforms first-order methods in terms of cost per iteration and solution quality.",

        "description": "Rapid development of next generation sequencing technologies produces a plethora of large-scale epigenome profiling data. Given the quantity of available epigenome datasets, obtaining a clear and comprehensive picture of the underlying regulatory network remains a challenge. The multitude of cell type heterogeneity and temporal changes in the epigenome make it impossible to assay all epigenome events for each type of cell. Computational model shows its advantages in capturing intrinsic correlations among epigenetic features and adaptively predicting epigenome marks in a dynamic scenario. Current progress in machine learning provides opportunities to uncover higher level patterns of epigenome interactions and integrating regulatory signals from different resources. My works aim to utilize public data resources to characterize, predict and understand the epigenome-wide regulatory relationship. The first part of my work is a novel computational model to predict in vivo transcription factor (TF) binding using base-pair resolution methylation data. The model combines cell-type specific methylation patterns and static genomic features, and accurately predicts binding sites of a variety of TFs among diverse cell types. The second part of my work is a computational framework to integrate sequence, gene expression and epigenome data for genome wide TF binding prediction. This extended supervised framework integrates motif features, context-specific gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles across multiple cell types and scale up the TF prediction task beyond the limits of candidate sites with limited known motifs. The third part of my work is a novel computational strategy for functional annotation of non-coding genomic regions. It takes advantage of the newly emerged, genome-wide and tissue-specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) information to help annotate a set of genomic intervals in terms of transcription regulation. This method builds a bridge connecting genomic intervals with biological pathways and pre-defined biological-meaningful gene sets. Tissue specificity analysis provides additional evidence of the distinct roles of different tissues in the disease mechanisms",

        "description": "In recent years, improvements in medical imaging and image-reconstruction algorithms have led to increased interest in the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) as a clinical tool in hemodynamics. While such methods have long been employed in the design of medical devices and in basic medical research, many of the techniques commonly employed in these contexts are not ideal in the clinical setting. In particular, in clinical settings typically one is faced with more demanding turnaround times for simulations, less powerful computational resources, and noisy, incomplete, or missing data.\\\\\n\\\\\nIn this thesis, we discuss these challenges and introduce CFD methods which are more practical for direct clinical application. Frequently in these settings, the variable of interest is the temporal average of some time-periodic quantity, such as wall shear-stress, over a cardiac cycle. In these cases, the standard procedure is to perform an unsteady simulation over several cardiac cycles and then to take the time average of the last one. Here, we propose to instead surrogate the unsteady time-averaged solution with the solution of a steady-state problem, allowing us to compute it directly. This approach, if properly applied, can dramatically lower computational cost as we show here; however in many respects the steady problem is arguably more difficult numerically than its unsteady counterpart.\\\\\n\\\\\nWe will address these difficulties and propose effective workarounds. In particular, we aim to develop methods for steady solvers that are \\textit{efficient}, \\textit{stable}, and \\textit{reliable}. Roughly speaking, this work is divided into three parts, with each part focusing on one of these aspects. Concerning efficiency, we extend the inexact algebraic factorization approach popular for the unsteady problem into the steady setting. We will address the issue of stability by taking inspiration from nonlinear filtering techniques used in turbulence modeling to develop stabilization techniques for the steady problem. Finally, we will develop and validate methods for assigning boundary conditions in data-deficient settings while maintaining reliability. Throughout each section, we will provide both theoretical and numerical justification for our methods.",

        "date": "2018-04-03",
        "description": "Varieties that fail to have rational points despite having local points for each prime are said to fail the Hasse principle. A systematic tool accounting for these failures is called the Brauer-Manin obstruction, which uses [subsets of] the Brauer group, Br X, to preclude the existence of rational points on a variety X. After fixing numerical invariants such as dimension, it is natural to ask which birational classes of varieties fail the Hasse principle, and moreover whether the Brauer group (or certain distinguished subsets) always explains this failure. In this talk, we will focus on K3 surfaces (e.g. a double cover of the plane branched along a smooth sextic curve) which are relatively simple surfaces in terms of geometric complexity, but whose arithmetic is more mysterious. For example, in 2014, Skorobogatov asked whether any odd torsion in the Brauer group of a K3 surface could obstruct the Hasse principle. We answer this question in the affirmative; via a purely geometric approach, we construct a 3-torsion transcendental Brauer class on a degree 2 K3 surface which obstructs the Hasse principle. Moreover, we do this without needing to explicitly write down a central simple algebra. This is joint work with Tony Varilly-Alvarado.",

        "description": "The next generation of computational science applications will require numerical solvers that are both reliable and capable of high performance on projected exascale platforms. In order to meet these goals, solvers must be resilient to soft and hard system failures, provide high concurrency on heterogeneous hardware configurations, and retain numerical accuracy and efficiency. This work focuses on the solution of large sparse systems of linear equations, for example of the kind arising from the discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs). Specifically, the goal is to investigate alternative approaches to existing solvers (such as preconditioned Krylov subspace or multigrid methods). To do so, we consider stochastic and deterministic accelerations of relaxation schemes. On the one hand, starting from a convergent splitting of the coefficient matrix, we analyze various types of Monte Carlo acceleration schemes applied to the original preconditioned Richardson (stationary) iteration. These methods are expected to have considerable potential for resiliency to faults when implemented on massively parallel machines. In this framework, we have identified classes of problems and preconditioners that guarantee convergence. On the other hand, we consider Anderson-type accelerations to increase efficiency and improve the convergence rate with respect to one level fixed point schemes. In particular, we focus on a recently introduced method called Alternating Anderson-Richardson (AAR). We provide theoretical results to explain the advantages of AAR over other similar schemes presented in literature and we show numerical results where AAR is competitive against restarted versions of the generalized minimum residual method (GMRES) for problems of different nature and different preconditioning techniques.",

        "description": "Singular value decompositions are a particularly attractive matrix factorization for ill-posed problems because singular value magnitudes reveal information about the relative importance of data in the matrix. However, computing a singular value decomposition is typically computationally infeasible for large problems, as the cost for traditional methods, such as Lanczos bidiagonalization-based approaches and randomized methods, scales linearly with the number of entries in the matrix times the number of singular values computed. In this work we present two new algorithms and one new hybrid approach for computing the singular value decomposition of matrices cheaply approximable as an ordered Kronecker summation decomposition. Unlike previous work using ordered Kronecker summation decompositions, the factorizations these methods produce are more accurate for certain classes of matrices and have nonnegative singular values. The three proposed methods are also faster, with lower computational and spatial complexity, although also lower accuracy, than traditional methods. Our Kronecker-based methods therefore enable singular value decomposition approximations on larger matrices than traditional methods, while providing more accurate results in many cases than previous Kronecker-based singular value decompositions. We demonstrate the efficacy of these methods on a variety of image deconvolution problems for which the image is modeled as a regular grid of data.",

        "description": "Graphs are a natural representation for modeling relationships between entities across many different fields of research. In real-world networks today, new data is constantly being produced, leading to the notion of dynamic graphs. An important query when analyzing graphs is to identify the most important vertices in a graph. Vertex importance is termed as centrality, and centrality scores can be used to provide rankings on the vertices of a graph. \nSpecifically, I focus on Katz Centrality, a linear algebra based metric that measures the affinity between vertices in a graph as a weighted sum of the number of walks between them. Calculating Katz scores involves approximating the solution to a linear system using iterative solvers. Currently, we do not have a sense of how the numerical error from the iterative method in the approximation to the centrality vector affects the identification of the highly ranked vertices. In the first part of the talk, I bridge the two research areas of numerical analysis and network analysis by providing insight into how bounding the error between the approximate and exact solution in the numerical problem affects the correct relative ranking of vertices in the data mining problem. \nTypically, Katz scores are calculated through linear algebra. In the second section of the talk, I present an new alternative, agglomerative method of calculating personalized Katz scores. The algorithm presented is several orders of magnitude faster than the typical linear algebra approach and is able to return good quality scores of vertices. Finally, updating centrality scores of the vertices in a dynamic graph quickly becomes expensive to recompute from scratch every time the underlying graph is changed, as is the case in evolving networks. I conclude the talk by presenting a new algorithm for updating the Katz scores of vertices in a dynamic graph that is faster than static recomputation while maintaining good quality of the scores returned.",

A basic finiteness result is that there are only finitely many degree-$d$ number fields of discriminant at most $X$; more generally, for any fixed global field $K$, there are only finitely many degree-$d$ extensions $L/K$ whose discriminant has norm at most $X$.  (The classical case is where $K = \\mathbb{Q}$.)\n\\\\\n\nWhen a set is finite, we greedily ask if we can compute its cardinality.  Write $N_d(K,X)$ for the number of degree-$d$ extensions of $K$ with discriminant at most $d$.  A folklore conjecture holds that $N_d(K,X)$ is on order $c_d X$.  In the case $K = \\mathbb{Q}$, this is easy for $d=2$, a theorem of Davenport and Heilbronn for $d=3$, a much harder theorem of Bhargava for $d=4$ and 5, and completely out of reach for $d > 5$.  More generally, one can ask about extensions with a specified Galois group $G$; in this case, a conjecture of Malle holds that the asymptotic growth is on order $X^a (\\log X)^b$ for specified constants $a,b$.\n\\\\\n\nI'll talk about two recent results on this old problem:\n\\\\\n\n1) (joint with TriThang Tran and Craig Westerland)  We prove that $N_d(\\mathbb{F}_q(t),X)) < c_{\\epsilon} X^{1+\\epsilon}$ for all $d$, and similarly prove Malle’s conjecture ``up to epsilon\" — this is much more than is known in the number field case, and relies on a new upper bound for the cohomology of Hurwitz spaces coming from quantum shuffle algebras:  https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04541\n\\\\\n\n2) (joint with Matt Satriano and David Zureick-Brown) The form of Malle's conjecture is very reminiscent of the Batyrev-Manin conjecture, which says that the number of rational points of height at most $X$ on a Batyrev-Manin variety also grows like $X^a (\\log X)^b$ for specified constants $a,b$.  What’s more, an extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ with Galois group $G$ is a rational point on a Deligne--Mumford stack called $BG$, the classifying stack of $G$.  A natural reaction is to say “the two conjectures is the same; to count number fields is just to count points on the stack BG with bounded height?”  The problem:  there is no definition of the height of a rational point on a stack.  I'll explain what we think the right definition is, and explain how it suggests a heuristic which has both the Malle conjecture and the Batyrev--Manin conjecture as special cases.",

However, their model was observed by Malle to have issues when the base field contains roots of unity. We explain that in this setting there are naturally defined additional invariants on the class group, and based on this we propose a refined model in the number field setting rooted in random matrix theory. Our conjecture is based on keeping track not only of the underlying group structure, but also certain natural pairings one can define in the presence of roots of unity. Specifically, if the base field contains roots of unity, we keep track of the class group G together with a naturally defined homomorphism $G^*[n] \\to G$ from the n-torsion of the Pontryagin dual of G to G.

As in the case of fields, the Brauer group is an important cohomological invariant of the scheme, featuring, for instance, in the Manin obstruction for rational points.\n\\\\\n\nMany of the properties of central simple algebras generalize to Azumaya algebras, but sometimes modifications are needed. For example, Albert characterized the central simple algebras admitting an involution of the first kind as those whose Brauer class is 2-torsion. While this fails for Azumaya algebras over a ring R, Saltman showed that the 2-torsion classes in the Brauer group of R are precisely those containing some representative admitting an involution of the first kind. Knus, Parimala and Srinivas later gave a quantitative version of this statement: If A is an Azumaya algebra of over R such that its Brauer class is 2-torsion, then there is an Azumaya algebra in the Brauer class of A that admits an involution and has degree 2*deg(A).\n\\\\\n\nIn this talk, we shall recall what are Azumaya algebras and how the Brauer group of a ring (or a scheme) is constructed.

        "description": "Sparse linear algebra problems, typically solved using iterative methods, are ubiquitous throughout scientific and data analysis applications and are often the most expensive computations in large-scale codes due to the high cost of data movement. Approaches to improving the performance of iterative methods typically involve modifying or restructuring the algorithm to reduce or hide this cost. Such modifications can, however, result in drastically different behavior in terms of convergence rate and accuracy. A clear, thorough understanding of how inexact computations, due to either finite precision error or intentional approximation, affect numerical behavior is thus imperative in balancing the tradeoffs between accuracy, convergence rate, and performance in practical settings. \n\nIn this talk, we focus on two general classes of iterative methods for solving linear systems: Krylov subspace methods and iterative refinement. We present bounds on the attainable accuracy and convergence rate in finite precision s-step and pipelined Krylov subspace methods, two popular variants designed for high performance. For s-step methods, we demonstrate that our bounds on attainable accuracy can lead to adaptive approaches that both achieve efficient parallel performance and ensure that a user-specified accuracy is attained. We present two such adaptive approaches, including a residual replacement scheme and a variable s-step technique in which the parameter s is chosen dynamically throughout the iterations. Motivated by the recent trend of multiprecision capabilities in hardware, we present new forward and backward error bounds for a general iterative refinement scheme using three precisions. The analysis suggests that on architectures where half precision is implemented efficiently, it is possible to solve certain linear systems up to twice as fast and to greater accuracy. \n\nAs we push toward exascale level computing and beyond, designing efficient, accurate algorithms for emerging architectures and applications is of utmost importance. We discuss extensions to machine learning and data analysis applications, the development of numerical autotuning tools, and the broader challenge of understanding what increasingly large problem sizes will mean for finite precision computation both in theory and practice.",

Anisotropic phenomena occur in many applications, ranging from shocks in compressible flows, steep boundary or internal layers in viscous flows around bodies, fronts of different nature to be sharply tracked. These problems typically require advanced methods of scientific computing that rely on a tessellation or “mesh” of the region of interest. The intrinsic directionalities of these dynamics call for an accurate control of the shape, the size and the orientation of mesh elements in contrast to standard isotropic meshes where the only parameter to choose is the element size. Metric-based techniques usually drive anisotropic mesh adaptation, the metric being derived by either heuristic or theoretical approaches. In the former case, the metric is identified by a numerical approximation of the Hessian or of the gradient of the discrete solution, coupled with an a priori error estimator. More rigorous - theoretically based - approaches move from a posteriori error analyses, i.e., from an explicit control of the discretization error or – in more sophisticated cases – of a functional of the error. This control is enhanced by an appropriate inclusion of the main directional features of the problem at hand.\\\\\n\\\\In this presentation, we focus on both heuristic and rigorous anisotropic error estimators.

In particular, we study implicit regularization properties of certain methods, we solve data-driven issues of existing methods, we explicitly show what optimization problems certain graph clustering procedures are solving, we prove that existing optimization methods have better performance and generalize to unweighted graphs, and finally we demonstrate how state-of-the-art methods can be efficiently parallelized for modern multi-core hardware.",

        "description": "A new era is emerging in the world of distributed computing with the growing popularity of blockchains (shared, replicated and distributed ledgers) and the associated databases as a way of integrating inter-organizational work. Originally, the concept of a distributed ledger was invented as the underlying technology of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. But the adoption and further adaptation of it for use in the commercial or permissioned environments is what is of utmost interest to me and hence will be the focus of this keynote. Computer companies like IBM and Microsoft, and many key players in different vertical industry segments have recognized the applicability of blockchains in environments other than cryptocurrencies. IBM did some pioneering work by architecting and implementing Fabric, and then open sourcing it. Now Fabric is being enhanced via the Hyperledger Consortium as part of The Linux Foundation. A few of the other efforts include Enterprise Ethereum, R3 Corda and BigchainDB. \n\nWhile there is no standard in the blockchain space currently, all the ongoing efforts involve some combination of database, transaction, encryption, consensus and other distributed systems technologies. Some of the application areas in which blockchain pilots are being carried out are: smart contracts, supply chain management, know your customer, derivatives processing and provenance management. In this talk, I will survey some of the ongoing blockchain projects with respect to their architectures in general and their approaches to some specific technical areas. I will focus on how the functionality of traditional and modern data stores are being utilized or not utilized in the different blockchain projects. I will also distinguish how traditional distributed database management systems have handled replication and how blockchain systems do it. Since most of the blockchain efforts are still in a nascent state, the time is right for database and other distributed systems researchers and practitioners to get more deeply involved to focus on the numerous open problems.",

In particular, we will focus on PDE-constrained formulations for diffeomorphic image registration, a classical inverse problem, which seeks to find pointwise correspondences between two or more images of the same scene. In its simplest form, the PDE constraints are the transport equations for the image intensities. We will augment these equations with a model of brain cancer progression to enable data assimilation in brain tumor imaging. We will see that our formulation yields strongly coupled, nonlinear, multiphysics systems that are challenging to solve in an efficient way. We will discuss the formulation, discretization, numerical solution, and the deployment of our methods in high-performance computing platforms. Our code is implemented in C/C++ and uses the message passing interface (MPI) library for parallelism.\\\\\n\\\\We will showcase results for clinically relevant problems, study numerical accuracy, rate of convergence, time-to-solution, inversion quality, and scalability of our solver. We will see that we can solve clinically relevant problems (50 million unknowns) in less than two minutes on a standard workstation. If we use 512 MPI tasks we can reduce the runtime to under 2 seconds, paving the way to tackle real-time applications. We will also showcase results for the solution of registration problems of unprecedented scale, with up to 200 billion unknowns.",

        "description": "Electro- and magnetoencephalography (EEG and MEG) have become important tools for non-invasive functional neuroimaging due to their unique time resolution. In many applications of EEG/MEG, the goal is to reconstruct the sources inside the brain volume that evoke the measured signal, which leads to a related ill-posed inverse problem (EEG/MEG inverse problem). To solve this inverse problem accurately, it is necessary to precisely simulate the electric/magnetic field caused by a point-like source inside the brain volume: the so-called forward problem of EEG/MEG. When aiming to take the individual head shape and conductivity distribution of the subject’s head into account, the EEG/MEG forward problem has to be solved numerically, e.g., using finite element methods (FEM). In this talk, we present examples showing how the use of novel mathematical methods can increase the accuracy of and help to better understand the uncertainties inherent to EEG/MEG forward solutions. We further analyze the influence of these uncertainties on EEG/MEG inverse solutions.",

Mis-dosing might result in preventable adverse event. Therefore, a robust decision support system would be helpful to clinicians by providing advisable dosing suggestions. Heparin is one of the sensitive drugs. In order to build up the decision support system for heparin patients, we present a clinician in the loop framework with deep reinforcement learning algorithm. There are two main objectives in this thesis, the first one is providing individualized dosing suggestion based on the multi-dimensional features of patients. The second one is evaluating the dosing predicted by our decision support system. We implemented several experiments to achieve these objectives. The data used in the experiments including simulated data, MIMIC-II intensive care unit data and Emory hospital intensive care unit data. There are two important processes with respect to our objectives. In the training process, the decision support system learned from the dosing executed by clinicians and the corresponding response of patients. In the evaluating process, we explored the results from several aspects and focused on the causality between variables and outcomes. The experimental results suggested that given the states of patients, our medication dosing support system is able to provide a reasonable recommendation",

In the case when $F$ is a single edge, a perfect $F$-packing is simply a perfect matching. For a given fixed $F$, it is generally the case that the decision problem whether an $n$-vertex $k$-graph $H$ contains a perfect $F$-packing is       NP-complete.\\\\\n\\\\In this talk we describe a general tool which can be used to determine classes of \n      (hyper)graphs for which the corresponding decision problem for perfect $F$-packings \n      is polynomial time solvable.

These challenges concern\na proper recommendation of tasks to users in such a away that they maximize their expected utility while at the same time\nmaximizing the probability that all the tasks are performed. The utility for the users can be based on the tasks the expected\nreward they are planning to obtain, and the distance to the assignments. These aspects can be predicted through tensorfactorization techniques. To set an example, a high-paying assignment might be far from a user, while a low paying assignment is nearby. Depending on the users’ preference, we seek to recommend a set of tasks that maximize the user’s utility. On the other hand, we also want to maximize the sum of probabilities that the tasks are performed, considering the interdependencies between users. We define the system utility as a convex linear combination of the user and the task utility and suggest approximation methods to recommend the tasks that yield the highest system utility.\\\\\n\\\\We also deal with the problem of truth inference, which focuses on integrating the responses from a mobile crowdsouring\nscenario and determining the true value. Many times, the answers from a mobile crowdsourcing scenario are noisy, contradicting\nor have missing values. We developed a recursive Bayesian system that updates the reputation model of the users, the\nprobability that the users where in the correct time and location, and the probability that the reports are true or false. We\nfurther enhanced this algorithm using a Kalman filter that predicts the true state of the event at each time-stamp using a\nhidden event model and which is updated with the reports from the users. Our method was compared against the naive\nmajority voting method as well as other state-of-the-art truth inference algorithms and our method shows a considerable\nimprovement.",

This technique is vital in many applications, such as medical imaging and astronomy. Finding the best transform can be phrased as solving a mathematical optimization problem. Due to the non-convexity of the objective function, commonly employed optimization techniques often generate local minimizers, limiting the accuracy of the registration. This thesis evaluates the applicability of a global optimization method, called as DDNCID, for image registration. Direct application of DDNCID in image registration could cause minimizers to be infeasible. Thus, a focus of this thesis is to add a bound constraint by imposing a barrier function into the objective function to extend DDNCID.",

In the late nineties, Serre generalized this theorem comprehensively to the case where \\Gamma is a subgroup of G(k), for G a reductive group, and answered the question of “complete reducibility” of \\Gamma in G (Seminaire Bourbaki, 2003). In 2014, Deligne generalized the results of Serre (of 1994) to the case when the V_i are semi-simple representations of a group scheme \\mathfrak{G}. In my talk I will present the recent work of mine with Deligne and Parameswaran where we consider the case when \\mathfrak{G} is a subgroup scheme of a reductive group G and generalize the results of Serre and Deligne.

        "description": "Accelerated optimization methods have gained wide applicability within the machine learning and optimization communities.  They are known for leading to optimal convergence rates among schemes that use only use gradient (first order) information in the convex case.  In the non-convex case, they appear to provide robustness to shallow local minima.  The intuitive idea is that by considering a particle with mass that moves in an energy landscape, the particle will gain momentum and surpass shallow local minimum and settle in in more wider, deeper local extrema in the energy landscape.  Although these techniques have been widely used, it was only within the last few years that theoretical attempts have been made to understand them and put them in a mathematical framework.  Recent work has shown that accelerated methods may be formulated with variational principles, although in finite dimensions.  Motivated by the success of accelerated methods in finite dimensional problems, we formulate optimization problems on infinite dimensional manifolds of diffeomorphisms using a generalization of this approach.  The talk will mainly be about the mathematical formulation and some simple examples to illustrate the advantages of this approach.  We note very large speed-ups in optical flow computation compared with standard approaches, and robustness to local minimum.  Finally, we outline considerations for generalizing this approach to video data and applications in motion-based object segmentation, which require one to optimize diffeomorphisms not just defined on the image domain, but evolving regions of interest that encompass the domain of each of the objects in the scene.\\\\\n\\\\Bio: Ganesh Sundaramoorthi received the PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA, and BS in Computer Engineering and BS Mathematics from the same institution in 2003.

In this talk, we first review some classical first-order accelerated descent methods, then introduce our proposed backtracking based accelerated descent methods, which are capable of hunting for more aggressive stepsize via conducting fewer number of line searches. A brief convergence analysis will be presented. The numerical results on structured (low rank and/or sparsity and/or group sparsity) network learning and total-variation based image reconstruction problems indicate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.",

Artificial intelligence might end the need for human work, or it might enslave humanity, or it might facilitate a kind of rapture into machines, where people's consciousnesses could upload and, through simulation, become immortal.\\\\\n\\\\Realized or not, those future visions offer a stark contrast with the reality of computing today: One where digital machinery is embedded in the ordinary, human world rather than leading away from it. The computational aspects of ordinary things from smartphone apps to internet-connected toasters have become goals unto themselves, rather than just a means to an end. As it spreads from desktops and back-offices to pockets, cameras, cars, and door locks, the affection people have with computers transfers onto other, even more ordinary objects. And the more people love using computers for everything, the more life feels incomplete unless it takes place inside them. Reality might have beaten the futurists to the punch, by turning computing into a way of life.",

It provides a hierarchical representation of the understanding of the domain knowledge; the DIKW model can reveal insights in systems biology by integrating different types of –omics data to form a comprehensive understanding.\\\\\n\\\\The foundation of systems biology is mining genomics data with machine learning. As the use of high-throughput, next-generation sequencing (NGS) applications grows, research in genomics enters the “big data” era. NGS applications can be divided into two major categories, short-read and long-read techniques, which are based on the principle differences in generating “reads”. A “read” is the fundamental element of genomic information. Short-read applications have been widely applied in several fields of genomics research, while long-read applications just came to market in 2011. Long-read applications have shown the potential to handle several areas of genomic questions. However, obtaining a well-defined genome still has a number of challenges in malaria systems biology research, and these challenges block researchers’ understanding the mechanism of the malaria disease progression.\\\\\n\\\\To tackle these challenges, we built a novel long-read NGS pipeline with third party modules and modified them to solve complicated Plasmodium genome assembly questions. These techniques provided a solution where traditional, short-read technologies could not because of the Plasmodium genome’s highly repetitive nature. We also implemented infrastructure to solve data management difficulties and developed several novel and robust pipelines to process and analyze the data. We host this pipeline along with other third party applications for data quality control, generic data visualization and data management tools. Our pipeline is also scalable and flexible to combine different technologies (long reads and short reads) to assemble the Plasmodium genome and conduct downstream annotations.\\\\\n\\\\This dissertation describes an overview of –omics research in the big data era and reveals the possibility of applying DIKW models through mining genomics data. A detailed discussion on how to apply our platform to solve questions, including multiple Plasmodium genome assemblies and annotations, and an initial discussion of applying machine learning approaches in a host-pathogen transcriptome analysis and its data mining applications are also provided.",

        "description": "Skyline, also known as Maxima in computational geometry or Pareto in business management field, is important for many applications involving multi-criteria decision making. The skyline of a set of multi-dimensional data points consists of the points for which no other point exists that is better in at least one dimension and at least as good in every other dimension. Although skyline computation and queries have been extensively studied in both computational geometry and database communities, there are still many challenges need to be fixed, especially in this big data ear. In this dissertation, I present several efficient and adaptive skyline computation algorithms. First, I show a faster output-sensitive skyline computation algorithm which is the state-of-the-art algorithm from the theoretical aspect. Second, traditional skyline computation is inadequate to answer queries that need to analyze not only individual points but also groups of points. To address this gap, I adapt the original skyline definition to the novel group-based skyline (G-Skyline), which represents Pareto optimal groups that are not dominated by other groups. Third, to facilitate skyline queries, I propose a novel concept Skyline Diagram, which given a set of points, partitions the plane into a set of regions, referred to as skyline polyominos. Similar to kth-order Voronoi diagram commonly used to facilitate k nearest neighbor (kNN) queries, any query points in the same skyline polyomino have the same skyline query results.",

        "description": "The talk is motivated by a practical issue: walk-based centrality measures regard all walks of the same length  as being equally important, whereas it is intuitively reasonable to rule out certain classes of walk. We focus here on non-backtracking walks. \nThe theory of zeta functions provides an expression for the generating function of non-backtracking walk counts on a directed network. This expression can be used to produce a centrality measure that eliminates backtracking walks at no cost.  The new centrality measure may be interpreted as standard Katz on a modified network, where self loops are added, and where non-reciprocated edges are augmented with negative weights. We also give a multilayer interpretation of the new centrality measure, where (negatively) weighted walks between layers compensate for backtracking walks on the only non-empty layer. \nWe further show that the radius of convergence of the generating function is determined by the spectrum of a three-by-three block matrix involving the original adjacency matrix. \nThis gives a means to choose appropriate values of the attenuation parameter and, in particular, we show that we obtain a larger range of choices for the attenuation parameter than that obtained for standard Katz. \nBy studying the effect of pruning operations on the network (i.e., removing nodes), we show that there is potential for the non-backtracking centrality to be computed more cheaply than Katz for appropriate network structures. Studying the limit as the attenuation parameter approaches its upper bound allows us to propose an eigenvector-based non-backtracking centrality measure in this directed network setting. \nWe illustrate the centrality measure on a synthetic network, where it is shown to eliminate a localization effect present in standard Katz centrality. We also give results for real networks.   \nFinally, we discuss some preliminary results on the non-backtracking version of the total communicability and of some alternating walk-based centrality measures.\\\\\n\\\\This talk is based on joint work with Prof. Peter Grindrod (University of Oxford, UK), Prof. Desmond J.

        "description": "Testing integers for primality and factoring large integers is an extremely important subject for our daily lives. Every time we use a credit card to make online purchases we are relying on the difficulty of factoring large integers for the security of our personal information. Similar encryption methods are used by governments around the world to protect their classi\fed information, stressing\nthe importance of the subject of primality testing and factoring algorithms to both personal and national security. Elementary number theory has been a key tool in the foundation of primality testing and factoring algorithms, speci\ffically the work of Euler and Fermat, whose developments on modular arithmetic give us key tools that we still use today in the more complex primality tests and factoring methods. More recently people have used deeper ideas from geometry, namely elliptic curves, to develop faster tests and algorithms. In this thesis we continue this trend, and develop new primality tests that utilize previous theory of elliptic curves over \fnite \felds. The primary point is that the points on these curves form a special group, which breaks down when working over Z/NZ, when\nN is not prime. Our theorems make use of the work of Kubert, Hasse, Mazur, and many more to yield a primality test that gives no false positives.",

        "description": "Let $C$ be a curve of genus at least two, and let $r$ be the rank of the rational points on its Jacobian. Under mild hypotheses on $r$, recent results by Katz, Rabinoff, Zureick-Brown, and Stoll bound the number of rational points on $C$ by a constant that depends only on its genus. Yet one expects an even stronger bound that depends favorably on $r$: when $r$ is small, there should be fewer points on $C$. In a 2013 paper, Stoll established such a ``rank-favorable\" bound for hyperelliptic curves using Chabauty's method. In the present work we extend Stoll's results to superelliptic curves. We also discuss a possible strategy for proving a rank-favorable bound for arbitrary curves based on the metrized complexes of Amini and Baker. Our results have stark implications for bounding the number of rational points on a curve, since $r$ is expected to be small for ``most\" curves.",

        "description": "Advances in microscopy imaging and genomics have created an explosion of patient data in the pathology domain. Whole-slide images of histologic sections contain rich information describing the diverse cellular elements of tissue microenvironments. These images capture, in high resolution, the visual cues that have been the basis of pathologic diagnosis for over a century. Each whole-slide image contains billions of pixels and up to a million or more microanatomic objects whose appearances hold important prognostic information. Combining this information with genomic and clinical data provides insight into disease biology and patient outcomes. Yet, due to the size and complexity of the data, the software tools needed to allow scientists and clinicians to extract insight from these resources are non-existent or limited. Additionally, current methods utilizing humans is highly subjective and not repeatable. This work aims to address these shortcomings with a set of open-source computational pathology tools which aim to provide scalable, objective and repeatable classification of histologic entities such as cell nuclei.\\\\\n\\\\\nWe first present a comprehensive interactive machine learning framework for assembling training sets for the classification of histologic objects within whole-slide images. The system provides a complete infrastructure capable of managing the terabytes worth of images, object features, annotations and metadata in real-time. Active learning algorithms are employed to allow the user and system to work together in an intuitive manner, allowing the efficient selection of samples from unlabeled pools of objects numbering in the hundreds of millions. We demonstrate how the system can be used to phenotype microvascular structures in gliomas to predict survival, and to explore the molecular pathways associated with these phenotypes. Quantitative metrics are developed to describe these structures.\\\\\n\\\\\nWe also present a scalable, high-throughput, deep convolutional learning framework for the classification of histologic objects is presented. Due to its use of representation learning, the framework does not require the images to be segmented, instead learning optimal task-specific features in an unbiased manner.  Addressing scalability, the graph-based, parallel architecture of the framework allows for the processing of large whole-slide image archives consisting of hundreds of slides and hundreds of millions of histologic objects. We explore the efficacy of various deep convolutional network architectures and demonstrate the system's capabilities classifying cell nuclei in lower grade gliomas.",

        "description": "Concerns on location privacy frequently arise with the rapid development of GPS enabled devices and location-based applications. In this dissertation, we study how to protect the locations of individual movement under temporal correlations. First, we propose three types of privacy notions, location privacy, customizable privacy, and the privacy for spatiotemporal events. Location privacy is used to protect the true location of a user at each timestamp; Customizable privacy means the user can configure personalized privacy notions depending different demand; Privacy for spatiotemporal events needs to be specially preserved because even if location privacy is guaranteed at each timestamp the spatiotemporal events can still be exposed. Second, we investigate how to preserve these privacy notions. We show that the traditional $\\ell_{1}$-norm sensitivity in differential privacy exaggerates the real sensitivity, and thus leads to too much noise in the released data. Hence we study the real sensitivity, called sensitivity hull, for the data release mechanism. Then we design the optimal location release mechanism for location privacy. We show that the data release mechanism has to be dynamically updated for the customizable privacy to guarantee the privacy is protectable, which is measured by a notion of degree of protection. To protect the spatiotemporal events we study how to derive the probability of the spatiotemporal events for arbitrary initial probabilities of adversaries. Then we check whether to release the location at each timestamp to bound the risk of the spatiotemporal events. Third, we implement these algorithms on real-world datasets to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness.",

The question of the minimum number of edges of an H saturated graph on n vertices, known as the saturation number, and the question of the maximum number of edges possible of an H -saturated graph, known as the Turán number, has been addressed for many different types of graphs. We are interested in the existence of H -saturated graphs for each edge count between the saturation number and the Turán number.\n \nWe determine the saturation spectrum of (Kt-e)-saturated graphs and Ft-saturated graphs.

        "description": "Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs) provide a single, graph-based semantic representation that abstracts away from the word order and syntactic structure of a sentence, resulting in a more language-neutral representation of its meaning. AMRs implements a simplified, standard neo-Davidsonian semantics. A word in a sentence either maps to a concept or a relation or is omitted if it is already inherent in the representation or it conveys inter-personal attitude (e.g., stance or distancing). The basis of AMR is PropBank’s lexicon of coarse-grained senses of verb, noun and adjective relations as well as the roles associated with each sense (each lexicon entry is a ‘roleset’). By marking the appropriate roles for each sense, this level of annotation provides information regarding who is doing what to whom. However, unlike PropBank, AMR also provides a deeper level of representation of discourse relations, non-relational noun phrases, prepositional phrases, quantities and time expressions (which PropBank largely leaves unanalyzed), as well as Named Entity tags with Wikipedia links. Additionally, AMR makes a greater effort to abstract away from language-particular syntactic facts. The latest version of AMR includes adding coreference links across sentences, including links to implicit arguments. This talk will explore the differences between PropBank and AMR, the current and future plans for AMR annotation, and the potential of AMR as a basis for machine translation. It will end with a discussion of areas of semantic representation that AMR is not currently addressing, which remain as open challenges.\\\\\n\\\\\nMartha Palmer is a Professor at the University of Colorado in Linguistics, Computer Science and Cognitive Science, and a Fellow of the Association of Computational Linguistics.. She works on trying to capture elements of the meanings of words that can comprise automatic representations of complex sentences and documents.

        "description": "We often turn to data to help us make sense of an uncertain world. However, the uncertainty in our data is often esoteric, complex, or counter-intuitive. It can be challenging to present this uncertainty, especially to audiences without backgrounds in statistics.\n\nCharts, graphs, and other visualizations of data address this issue by making people into “visual statisticians:” we can estimate statistical properties through visual inspection. However, just as statistical measures can be subject to bias, visualizations can also introduce bias. \n\nIn this talk, I show how designers can intervene to create new visualizations that correct these biases, and improve the judgments of visual statisticians. From this perspective of designing for de-biasing, I focus on two common visualizations: error bars and thematic maps. I present visual alternatives for error bars that avoid “within-the-bar” bias while also promoting statistically grounded comparisons between means. I also present “Surprise Maps,” a technique for thematic maps that relies on Bayesian reasoning to highlight interesting regions that might otherwise be hidden in traditional maps. I conclude with a discussion of remaining challenges for visual de-biasing, and how we might use visualizations to encourage better, data-driven decision-making.",

What properly colored subgraphs does c necessarily contain?\n\n\nIn this talk, we will be interested in spanning subgraphs of K_n that have bounded maximum degree or the total number of cherries, i.e., the paths on three vertices. We will also mention similar questions for hypergraphs, as well as analogous          problems concerned with rainbow subgraphs in edge colorings of K_n, where the total number of appearances for each color is bounded.\n\n\nOne of our main results confirms the following conjecture of Shearer from 1979: If G is an n-vertex graph with O(n) cherries and c is a coloring of E(K_n) such that at each vertex every color appears only constantly many times, then c contains a properly colored copy of G.\n\n\nThe talk is based on a joint work with Nina Kamcev and Benny Sudakov.",

Then I will discuss how we can trace individual rays of light to describe how a mirror should work. I will show previous examples of optical design such as a non-reversing mirror and a panoramic mirror. Finally, I will turn to the specific example of a car mirror and show one optical design technique that I use. The standard passenger side mirror on a car has a limited field of view which results in a blind spot. Other mirrors, such as spherical mirrors, reduce the blind spot but distort the image. My goal is to find a construction for a passenger side mirror that reduces the blind spot and but creates less distortion than a spherical mirror. The idea central to our construction is the concept of an eigensurface. In general, if a surface is viewed in a curved mirror, it appears distorted. However, there could exist a surface that appears invariant in a particular curved mirror. I will show how I\nuse this idea of eigensurfaces to find a mirror that could work as a passenger side car mirror.",

For the family $x^2 + c$ of quadratic dynamical systems, the corresponding modular curves are smooth in characteristic zero. We give several results about when these curves have good/bad reduction to characteristic $p$, as well as when the reduction is irreducible.

It is a theorem due to Loïc Merel that for every integer d the set of isomorphism classes of groups occurring as the torsion subgroup of a number field of degree d is finite. If a torsion subgroup occurs for a certain degree, then one can also ask for how many distinct pairwise non-isomorphic elliptic curves this happens. The question which torsion groups can occur for infinitely many non-isomorphic elliptic curves of a fixed degree is studied during this talk. The main result is a complete classification of the torsion subgroups that occur infinitely often for degree 5 and 6.

Therefore, we propose novel methods to build robust task management frameworks to handle uncertainty and ensure privacy in MCS applications.

These studies received a major boost in the past decade due to the availability of web data (e.g., social networks, blogs and review web sites). However, due to the nature of the utilized dataset, these studies were confined to behaviors that were observed mostly in the virtual world. Differing from all the earlier work, here, we aim to study social behaviors by observing people’s behaviors in the real world.  This is now possible due to the availability of large high-resolution spatiotemporal location data collected by GPS-enabled mobile devices through mobile apps (Google’s Map/Navigation/Search/Chrome, Facebook, Foursquare, WhatsApp, Twitter) or through online services, such as geo-tagged contents (tweets from Twitter, pictures from Instagram, Flickr or Google+ Photo), etc.\nIn particular, we focus on inferring two specific social measures: 1) pair-wise strength -- the strength of social connections between a pair of users, and 2) pair-wise influence - the amount of influence that an individual exerts on another, by utilizing the available high-fidelity location data representing people’s movements. \nFinally, we argue that due to the sensitivity of location data and user privacy concerns, these inferences cannot be largely carried out on individually contributed data without privacy guarantees. Hence, we discuss open problems in protecting individuals’ location information while enabling these inference analyses.",

It can be shown that all of our privacy preserving algorithms satisfy a rigorous privacy guarantee known as differential privacy, which has been the de facto standard for privacy protection.

We investigate the relation between these two invariants for hyperelliptic curves of arbitrary genus.",

        "description": "We construct a Ramsey class whose objects are Steiner systems. In contrast to the situation with general r-uniform hypergraphs, it turns out that simply putting linear orders on their sets of vertices is not enough for this purpose: we also have to strengthen the notion of subobjects used from induced subsystems to something we call strongly induced subsystems.\nMoreover we study the Ramsey properties of other classes of Steiner systems obtained from this class by either forgetting the order or by working with the usual notion of subsystems. This leads to a perhaps surprising induced Ramsey theorem in which it designs get coloured. \nThis is joint work with Vindya Bhat, Jaroslav Nevsetvril, and Vojtvech Rodl.",

        "description": "The objective of this dissertation is to study the relationship between network-based centrality measures and epidemic outcome. Determining the key players in contagion processes can inform disease-prevention strategies. We analyze a time-stamped, person-to-person contact network based on human mobility movements within a busy, urban hospital. Movement patterns identified a small number of locations as hubs of activity. Linear algebraic techniques were used to compute a recently proposed temporal centrality measure applied to the empirical network; comparisons with traditional centrality measures were performed to determine if the inclusion of temporal information provides additional insights. Linear regression techniques were employed to describe the relationships between the quantities of interest. We find that while temporal centrality can at times identify key players not captured by traditional measures, it does not necessarily outperform non-temporal measures with respect to predicting epidemic outcome. Strategic removal of connections between highly central nodes resulted in an exponential decrease in the structural connectivity of the network, but this did not translate to a reduction in epidemic outcome. We conclude that contagion on temporal networks is extremely robust to changes in the network, and while network-based centrality can help to identify key players in an epidemic process, more work needs to be done to build an epidemic-containment strategy based on the information afforded by network-based analyses.",

Roughly spoken, the goal is to automatically establish correspondences between points in different projections of a scene. In particular, in medical imaging, this problem is very important and used for applications such as motion correction or data fusion. Several examples displaying different facets of the problem are discussed. A mathematical framework for the correspondence problem is outlined. Starting point is a variational formulation, where a joint energy is to be minimized on an appropriate set. Modular building blocks such as distance measures and regularizers are briefly discussed and related to particular applications. Finally, a brief outlook on constrained image registration is presented. Constraints are used to improve the modeling by restricting the admissible set in a smart way.",

        "description": "The main objective of this study is to build successful investment strategies and devise optimal portfolio structures by exploiting the power of forecast of our financial crisis indicators based on random matrix theory. While using daily data constituted of the components of a major equity index like the Standard and Poor’s 500 or the Shanghai-Shenzhen CSI 300, the financial crisis indicators used in this paper are of two kinds. \nFirstly we consider the financial crisis indicators based on measuring the Hellinger distance between the empirical distribution of the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix of those index components and a distribution of reference built to either reflect a calm or agitated market situation.\nSecondly, we consider the financial crisis indicators based on the study of the spectral radius of the correlation matrix of the index components where the coefficients have been weighted in order to give more importance to the stock components that satisfy a chosen characteristic related to the structure of the index, market conditions or the nature of the companies which are part of the index. For example, we will attempt to give more importance in the computation of the indicators to the most traded stocks, the stocks from the companies with the highest market capitalization or from the companies with an optimal debt to capital ratio (financial leverage). Our optimal investment strategies exploit the forecasting power of the financial crisis indicators described above in order to produce a ‘buy’, ‘sell’ or ‘stay put’ signal every day that is able to anticipate most of the market downturns while keeping the number of false positives at an acceptable level. Such tools are very valuable for investors who can use them to anticipate market evolution in order to maximize their profit and limit their losses as well as for market regulators who can use those tools to anticipate systemic events and therefore attempt to mitigate their effects.",

A further increase of the dynamic frame rate can be achieved by exploiting the temporal redundancy of the data through the use of sparsity-constrained dynamic models. \nWhile simulated data from numerical phantoms will be used to illustrate the potential of the developed methods, we will also discuss the results of their application to different measured data sets.

In these contexts, standard isotropic meshes often turn out to be inadequate since they allow one to tune only the size of the mesh elements while completely missing the directional features of the phenomenon at hand. On the contrary, via an anisotropic mesh adaptation it is possible to control the size as well as the orientation and the shape of the mesh elements.\nIn this presentation we focus on an anisotropic setting based on the concept of metric. In particular, to generate the adapted mesh, we derive a proper metric stemming from an error estimator. This procedure leads to optimal grids which minimize the number of elements for an assigned accuracy. After introducing the theoretical context, several test cases will be provided to emphasize the numerical benefits led by an anisotropic approach.\nAn overview of the ongoing research will complete the presentation.",

These type of problems appear in numerous areas like weather prediction, ocean physics, or the reconstruction of porous media flows. In this talk we will consider the problem of diffeomorphic image registration with applications in medical imaging.\nWe use a PDE constrained optimization formulation, where the constraints are the transport equations for a given scalar field, which in our case is a grayscale image. We will compare semi-Lagrangian and spectral collocation schemes, discuss a two-level Hessian preconditioner, and showcase a parallel implementation on distributed memory architectures.. We invert for a velocity field that governs the transport equation for the image deformation. The objective functional consists of an L^2 mismatch term and a regularization functional that penalizes the H^k-norm of the velocity field and its divergence. We discretize the optimality conditions using a pseudospectral discretization in space with a Fourier basis. We use a globalized, preconditioned, inexact, matrix-free, reduced space Newton-Krylov method to solve for an optimal, diffeomorphic flow field. The reduced Hessian is an ill-conditioned, dense, and compact operator; efficiently solving this system represents a significant challenge.\nWe introduce and analyze a semi-Lagrangian formulation that, together with a nested two-level Hessian preconditioner, yields a 20x speedup compared to the state of the art. We will showcase convergence results, and assess strong and weak scalability of our solver for problem sizes of up to 25 billion unknowns on up to 1024 compute nodes on the Texas Advanced Computing Center's systems.

        "description": "Computational phenotyping is the process of converting heterogeneous electronic health records (EHRs) into meaningful clinical concepts (phenotypes). Tensor factorization has been shown as a successful unsupervised approach for discovering phenotypes. However, tensor methods have some major limitations for phenotyping:\n1)\tunable to incorporate existing medical knowledge;\n2)\tfail to handle high-order tensors (e.g., order > 5) .\nWe will talk about two of our recent developments in addressing these challenges:\n\nFirst, we proposed Rubik, a constrained non-negative tensor factorization and completion method for phenotyping. Rubik incorporates 1) guidance constraints to align with existing medical knowledge, and 2) pairwise constraints for obtaining distinct, non-overlapping phenotypes. Rubik also has built-in tensor completion that can significantly alleviate the impact of noisy and missing data. We evaluate Rubik on two large EHR datasets. Our results show that Rubik can discover more meaningful and distinct phenotypes than the baselines.\nSecond, we extended a theoretical framework called tensor networks for analyzing high-order tensors. We developed an efficient sparse hierarchical Tucker model (Sparse H-Tucker) for finding interpretable tree-structured factorizations from sparse high-order tensor. Sparse H-Tucker scales nearly linearly in the number of non-zero tensor elements. We applied Sparse H-Tucker on a real EHR dataset for learning a disease hierarchy. The resulting tree structure provides an interpretable disease hierarchy, which is confirmed by a clinical expert.\nBio  Jimeng Sun is an Associate Professor of School of Computational Science and Engineering at College of Computing in Georgia Institute of Technology.

We exploit Merkurjev's fundamental computations of R-equivalence classes of adjoint classical groups and give a recursive construction to produce an infinite family of non-rational adjoint groups coming from quadratic forms.\nIn a different direction, we address Serre's injectivity question which asks whether a principal homogeneous space under a linear algebraic group admitting a zero cycle of degree one in fact has a rational point.  We give a positive answer to this question for any smooth connected reductive k-group whose Dynkin diagram contains connected components only of type A_n, B_n or C_n by relating Serre's question to the norm principles previously proved by Barquero and Merkurjev. \nThe study of norm principles are interesting in their own right and we examine in detail the case of groups of type (non-trialitarian) D_n  and get a  scalar obstruction defined up to spinor norms whose vanishing will imply the norm principle for them. This in turn will also yield a positive answer to Serre's question for all connected reductive k-groups of classical type.",

However there is a slightly more exotic way to view this construction once we realize that the Tate module of an elliptic curve is just the abelianization of the etale fundamental group of the punctured torus.\nIn this talk, we discuss how to construct a class of Galois representations by considering covers of elliptic curves which are branched over one point.  We discuss how this is related to the question of surjectivity of certain Galois representation, and how to construct representations with image isomorphic to the holomorph of the quaternions.  We will not assume extensive knowledge of etale cohomology.  This is joint work with Rachel Davis.",

The author proves for any Galois extension of number fields K/Q, there exist bounded gaps between primes with a given ``splitting condition'' in K, and the primes in question may be restricted to short intervals.  Furthermore, we can count these gaps with the correct order of magnitude.  This follows from proving a short interval variant of the Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem in a Chebotarev setting and generalizing the recent progress in sieve theory due to Maynard and Tao.  The author also proves several log-free zero density estimates for Rankin-Selberg L-functions with effective dependence on the key parameters.  From this, the author proves an approximation of the short interval prime number theorem for Rankin-Selberg L-functions, an approximation of the short interval version of the Sato-Tate conjecture, and a bound on the least norm of a prime ideal counted by the Sato-Tate conjecture.  All of these results exhibit effective dependence on the key parameters.",

        "description": "The relationship between elliptic curves and modular forms informs many modern mathematical discussions, including the solution of Fermat's Last Theorem and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture. In this thesis we explore properties of elliptic curves, a particular family of modular forms called eta-quotients and the relationships between them. We begin by discussing elliptic curves, specifically considering the question of which quadratic fields have elliptic curves with everywhere good reduction. By revisiting work of Setzer, we expand on congruence conditions that determine the real and imaginary quadratic fields with elliptic curves of everywhere good reduction and rational j-invariant. Using this, we determine the density of such real and imaginary fields. In the next chapter, we begin investigating the properties of eta-quotients and use this theory to prove a conjecture of Han related to the vanishing of coefficients of certain combinatorial functions. We prove the original conjecture that relates the vanishing of the hook lengths of partitions and the number of 3-core partitions to the coefficients of a third series by proving a general theorem about this phenomenon. Lastly, we will see how these eta-quotients relate to the Weierstrass mock modular forms associated with certain elliptic curves. Alfes, Griffin, Ono, and Rolen have shown that the harmonic Maass forms arising from Weierstrass zeta-functions associated to modular elliptic curves encode the vanishing and non-vanishing for central values and derivatives of twisted Hasse-Weil L-functions for elliptic curves. We construct a canonical harmonic Maass form for the five curves proven by Martin and Ono to have weight 2 newforms with complex multiplication that are eta-quotients. The holomorphic part of this harmonic Maass form is referred to as the Weierstrass mock modular form. We prove that the derivative of the Weierstrass mock modular form for these five curves is itself an eta-quotient or a twist of one.",

        "description": "The nature of rational solutions to polynomial equations is one which is fundamental to Number Theory and more generally, to Mathematics.  Given the straightforward nature of this problem, one may be surprised by the difficulty when it comes to producing solutions.\nThe Hasse principle states that if an equation has local solutions everywhere then there is a global solution.  Polynomials rarely satisfy this property.  However Colliot-Thelene conjectures that another test on local solutions, the Brauer-Manin obstruction, exists for every rationally connected, smooth, projective, geometrically integral variety failing to satisfy the Hasse Principle.\nWe wish to explore the existence of a Brauer-Manin obstruction to the Hasse principle for certain families of surfaces.  The first of which is a cubic surface written down by Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer in 1975,\n\nNorm_{L/K}(ax+by+\\phi z+\\psi w) = (cx+dy)Norm_{K/k}(x+\\theta y).\n\nThe left-hand side of this equality is a cubic norm and the right-hand side contains a quadratic norm.  They make a correspondence between this failure and the Brauer-Manin obstruction, recently discovered by Manin, in a few specific instances.\nUsing techniques developed in the ensuing 40 years, we show that a much wider class of norm form cubic surfaces have a Brauer-Manin obstruction to the Hasse principle, thus verifying the Colliot-Thelene conjecture for infinitely many cubic surfaces.\nThe second family is a general set of diagonal K3 surfaces,\n\nw^2=ax^6+by^6+cz^6+dw^6,\n\ndefined as varieties in weighted projective space.  This section focuses on the particular geometry of these surfaces, verifying that their Picard rank is generically 19.  We conclude by computing the Galois cohomology group, H^1(Gal(\\bar{k}/k),Pic\\bar{X})\\simeq (\\mathbf{Z}/2\\mathbf{Z})^3.  The computation of this group is fundamental to determining the existence of a Brauer-Manin obstruction.",

        "description": "Over the last decade, differential privacy (DP) has emerged as the standard privacy notion for research in privacy-preserving data analysis and publishing.  However, there is an ongoing debate about the meaning and value of DP.  Some hail that the notion of DP offers strong privacy protection regardless of the adversary's prior knowledge while enabling all kinds of data analysis.  Others offer criticisms regarding DP's privacy guarantee and utility limitations.\nIn this talk, we focus on two issues.  One is what does DP mean?  More precisely, under what condition(s), the notion of DP delivers the promised privacy guarantee?  We show that DP is based on the following Personal Data Principle: \"Data privacy means giving an individual control over his or her personal data.  Privacy does not mean that no information about the individual is learned, or no harm is done to an individual.  Enforcing the latter is infeasible and unreasonable.''  Furthermore, the question of when DP is adequate is not just a technical question and depends on legal and ethical considerations.\nIn the second part of the talk, we give a survey of the state of the art in publishing a summary of a relational dataset, ranging from publishing histograms for one-dimensional and two-dimensional datasets, to answering marginal queries for datasets with dozens of dimensions, and finally to finding frequent itemsets in transactional datasets with thousands or more of dimensions.\n\nBrief Bio:\nNinghui Li is a Professor of Computer Science at Purdue University, where he has been a faculty member since 2003.

        "date": "2016-01-28",
        "description": "The rapid development of positioning techniques has enabled information to be widely collected on continuously moving objects, such as vehicles and mobile device users. Since moving object data is large and updates frequently, database systems supporting massive updates and predictive spatio-temporal queries are essential for modern location-based services. Traditional spatial accessing or indexing mechanisms barely consider velocity information of the objects to improve query performance. In this dissertation, I present novel approaches that augment existing tree-based and grid-based indexes for moving object databases with velocity information and prove that these approaches can significantly improve query performance with comparable update performance in both in-disk and in-memory scenarios.. Predictive range query, which retrieves objects in a certain spatial region at some future time, is the most motivating type of spatio-temporal queries in real world location-based services. Different from predicting future location of a single moving object, performing predictive range queries over large moving object databases incurs much heavier computational burden, which makes efficiency as important as accuracy for real-time spatio-temporal enquiries. Motion functions, which predict future object locations based on some analytic functions, can efficiently process short-term predictive range queries, since they can be seamlessly embedded into existing indexing mechanisms. However, motion functions cannot perform long-term predictions since motions of the moving objects might change over time. Other prediction functions such as trajectory patterns and statistical graphic models are more accurate but less efficient. In this dissertation, I also present a pruning mechanism that improve the performance for long-term predictive range queries based on (high-order) Markov chain models learned from historical trajectories. The key to our approach is to devise compressed representations for sparse multi-dimensional matrices, and leverage efficient algorithms for matrix computations. We conduct experiments on both simulated and real world datasets to demonstrate that our methods gain significant improvements over other existing methods.",

I will introduce auction theory, prove of the Unimodularity Theorem, and discuss special cases such as stable matching with transferable utility. This is based on joint work with Ngoc Mai Tran.",

First, I will present a method for automatic creation of a well-formatted, readable transcript for a video from closed captions or ASR output. Readable transcripts are a necessary precursor to indexing, ranking and content-based summarization of videos. Our approach uses acoustic and lexical features extracted from the video and the raw transcription/caption files. Empirical evaluations of our approach show that it outperforms baseline methods. Second, I will present a method for video summarization that uses title-based image search results to find visually important shots. A video title is often carefully chosen to be maximally descriptive of the video’s main topic, and hence images related to the title can serve as a proxy for important visual concepts of the main topic. However, images searched using the title can contain noise (images irrelevant to video content) and variance (images of different topics). Our approach to video summarization is a novel co-archetypal analysis technique that learns canonical visual concepts shared between video and images, but not in either alone, by finding a joint-factorial representation of the two data sets. Experimental results show that our approach produces superior quality summaries compared to several recently proposed approaches. I will conclude the talk with some ideas for future work on video summarization using multimodal representations.",

In 1975, Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer gave some early examples of cubic surfaces which have a Brauer-Manin obstruction:\n       (cubic norm) = (linear) (quadratic norm).\n\nThey make a rough number theoretic argument for the Brauer-Manin obstruction in the case that the Hasse principle fails, focusing on the particular fields and constants.

If good preconditioners are required for fast convergence, we may need to compute many preconditioners. This can be very expensive. One could compute a single preconditoner for all systems or recompute the preconditioner infrequently, but this may lead to very large number of iterations. An alternative is to update the preconditioner in some efficient manner while maintaining the quality of the preconditioner.  One such approach is to update the preconditioner by low-rank updates, typically applied in a  multiplicative way, which can be done very cheaply. However, this has the problem that  applying the preconditioner (during the iterative solve) gets increasingly expensive.  We discuss two methods to truncate such low-rank updates while maintaining good  preconditioner quality. We give applications from solid state physics and nonlinear partial differential equations.",

This cohomology is a finite abelian group in each degree and so is a product of its p-primary components, as p ranges over the prime divisors of the group order. There are corresponding \"p-local\" constructions at the group and space level that reflect the p-primary part of group cohomology.  At the level of the group, one is led to a category called the p-fusion system. At the space level, one has p-completion in the sense of Bousfield and Kan. That these two constructions preserve essentially the same data is known as the Martino-Priddy conjecture, which was first proved in 2004 (p odd) and 2006 (p=2) by B. Oliver.

        "description": "Geometric range search is a fundamental primitive for spatial data analysis in SQL and NoSQL databases. It has extensive applications in Location-Based Services, computer-aided design and computational geometry. Due to the dramatic increase of data size, it is necessary for companies and organizations to outsource their spatial datasets to third-party cloud services (e.g.  Amazon) in order to reduce storage and query processing costs, but meanwhile with the promise of no privacy leakage to the third party. Searchable encryption is a technique to perform meaningful queries on encrypted data without revealing privacy. However, geometric range search on spatial data has not been fully investigated nor supported by existing searchable encryption schemes. The main challenge, is that compute-and-then-compare operations required by many range search algorithms cannot be supported by any existing crypto primitives. In this talk, I will present our recent research progresses in privacy-preserving geometric range search over encrypted spatial data. The general approach is to adopt new representations of spatial data, and transform the range query algorithm to avoid compute-and-then-compare operations, so that existing efficient crypto primitives can be integrated. I will present two designs, the first one focuses on circular range search, and the second one can handle arbitrary geometric range query and is more efficient. The security of both schemes are formally proven under standard cryptographic assumptions.  Finally, I will discuss some future research challenges and directions in this area.",

In it, he introduces infinite product generating functions and uses them to derive what is now known as Euler’s partition identity, an English translation of which reads as follows:\n“The number of different ways a given number can be expressed as the sum of different whole numbers is the same as the number of ways in which the same number can be expressed as the sum of odd numbers, whether the same of different.” In modern terminology, the preceding is rephrased as “the number of partitions of n into distinct parts equals the number of partitions of n into odd parts.”\n\nIn 1883, J.W.L. Glaisher published the first bijective proof of Euler’s partition identity, along with a natural generalization: “the number of partitions of n where no part appears more than m - 1 times equals the number of partitions of n where no part is divisible by m.” By combining a construction of P.A. MacMahon called “partitions of infinity” and knowledge of George Andrews' “partition ideals of order 1” with Glaisher’s bijective proof of Euler’s identity, we are led to discover a large class of partition identities with straightforward bijective proofs.\nThis is joint work with James Sellers and Gary Mullen of Penn State.

        "description": "Image registration is a key task in image analysis. Its applications range from fusing multimodal data over object tracking to motion modeling, e.g. for the respiratory system. In the latter example large motions occur and inside the lungs no foldings of tissue are to be expected. Hence it is appropriate to model the movement as a diffeomorphic nonlinear trans- formation. As requirements like diffeomorphic transformations and the capability of capturing large motions are often necessary in image registration the ”Large Deformations Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM)” approach is very useful.\n\nThe theoretical foundations for LDDMM were laid in the late 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s by Grenander, Christensen, Miller, Trouve, Younes and others. In 2005 Beg et al. [1] provided a practical algorithm to solve the LDDMM image registration problem.\nLDDMM is related to optical flow. In [2] optical flow problems were solved using an optimal control approach. Following a similar approach in 2009 the LDDMM model was used for image registration from an optimal control perspective in [3].\n\nIn the talk I will give an introduction to LDDMM following loosely [3] and start with the matching of scalars, which results in a tool for linear regression. In this example, the two different concepts of relaxation and shooting are illustrated. In the relaxation approach the optimization is performed regarding the complete temporal velocity field. However, in the shooting approach the optimization is only over the initial condition, i.e., slope and possibly y-intercept of the line. I will then discuss how to extend these ideas to the problem of image matching and how to discretize the optimization problem using consistent Runge-Kutta methods for the transport equation and its adjoint.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Mirza Faisal Beg, Michael I.

In particular, we disprove a longstanding conjecture of Caccetta and Haggkvist (that in every diameter-2-critical graph, the average edge-degree is at most the number of vertices), which promised to completely solve the extremal problem for diameter-2-critical graphs. On the other hand, we prove that the same claim holds for all higher diameters, and is asymptotically tight, resolving the average edge-degree question in all cases except diameter-2. We also apply our techniques to prove several bounds for the original extremal question, including the correct asymptotic bound for diameter-k-critical graphs, and an upper bound of (\\frac{1}{6} + o(1))n^2 for the number of edges in a diameter-3-critical graph.

        "description": "Glycomics is the study of the structure and function of carbohydrates in biological systems. In comparison to the expansion of the more established fields of genomics and proteomics, the integration of glycans and glycomics in biomedical research has lagged far behind. Glycomics has the potential to be included as another foundational science in the study of human disease, since glycans play have major roles in certain hereditary diseases, infectious diseases, and cancer. The structural and functional complexity of glycans coupled with the lack of robust bioinformatics impedes the integration of glycoscience into the scientific mainstream. The central objective of this thesis is to develop novel computational methods and bioinformatics tools to advance the understanding of structure and function relationships of glycans and their recognition and binding by Glycan Binding Proteins (GBPs).\n\nWe have developed a method to automate the interpretation of glycan microarray data to identify the glycan determinants that are necessary for binding. We evaluate this method against GBPs of known specificities to validate the results. We demonstrate this approach revealed new recognition motifs that had not been previously reported.\nWe also present a novel computational approach to automate the sequencing of glycans based on a method known as “Metadata-Assisted Glycan Sequencing” (MAGS), which combines analyses of glycan structures by mass spectrometry (MS) and glycan microarray technology to fully characterize glycan sequences. We target the soluble glycans in the human milk glycome as the first meta-glycome to be defined using this method.\n\nTo facilitate access by scientists to glycomics information, we developed an open-source, web-based bioinformatics platform for glycan microarray analysis. The platform provides interactive visualization features to view, search, and compare experimental data and also includes glycan motif mining and analysis.\n\nIn addressing these research areas, we have developed novel methods, algorithms, and software tools applied to the field of glycomics. These contributions will aid in the elucidation of the human glycome and a greater understanding of the diverse and important biological functions of glycans.",

The cloud performs the anonymization in a top-down fashion. It proceeds from the most generalized values of attributes (serve as the root of the tree) and specializes them (i.e., generate less generalized values as siblings of the parent node) in every iteration. A candidate value is selected for specialization in each iteration based on its score. The score of each candidate is calculated securely using multiple cryptographic protocols to ensure security.

        "description": "Computational modeling of healthy and diseased electrocardiology (EC) has a great\npotential for use in improved diagnosis and prognosis of cardiac arrhythmia and also\nbetter therapy planning. However, recent computational methods in electrocardiology\nusually suffer from three major limitations that hinder their use in the clinic: lack\nof efficient model personalization strategy; high computational demand from the EC\nsolver; lack of good trade-off between the simplification of cellular ionic models and\nthe demand on keeping sufficient biophysical details. The work in this thesis aims at\nsolving these challenging issues.\n\nThe principal part of the work is on the estimation of cardiac conductivities that\nparameterize the bidomain/monodomain model—the current standard model for\nsimulating cardiac potential propagation. We consider a variational data assimilation\napproach by regarding the parameters as control variables to minimize the mismatch\nbetween computed and measured potentials. The existence of a minimizer of this misfit\nfunction is proved. We significantly improve the numerical approaches in the literature\nby resorting to a derivative-based optimization method with the settlement of some\nchallenges due to discontinuity. The core of our numerical results is in 3D, on both\nidealized and real geometries. The reliability and stability of the conductivity estimation\napproach are demonstrated in presence of noise and with an imperfect knowledge of\nother model parameters.\n\nWe then focus on the computational cost reduction for the inverse conductivity\nproblem. The Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) approach was taken for forward\nmodel reduction, along with the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM) for\ntackling nonlinearity. The POD-DEIM combination is finally applied for the inverse\nproblem of conductivity estimation. In this application, we obtain a very small set of\nsamples by sampling the parameter space using the polar coordinates and densifying\nthe boundary layer utilizing Gauss-Lobatto nodes. In usage of the POD-DEIM reduced\norder model, the computational effort can be reduced to up to 10% in conductivity\nestimation.\nThe last part of the work is on the development of a data-driven approach to the\nreduction of state-of-the-art cellular models used for atria simulation. The reduced\nmodel predicts cellular action potentials (AP) in a simple form but is effective in\ncapturing the physiological complexity of the original model. We start from an AP\nmanifold learning, and continue with a regression model construction to predict few\nleading components in the reduced AP manifold. The reduced cellular model drastically\nimproves the performance of atrial tissue-level electrophysiological modeling (up to two\norder of magnitudes) and enables almost real-time computations. The same modeling\ntechnique can be extended to the study of other excitable myocardial tissues.",

        "date": "2015-08-20",
        "description": "Coronary stents expand the vessel to alleviate blockage, and they have been used for decades to save lives from coronary heart disease. Technological development has driven the evolution of stenting from bare or drug-coated metallic stents to the newly invented bioresorbable vascular stent (BVS). Rather than leaving a permanent metallic structure in the vessel,  a BVS can dissolve in the body after opening the blocked artery, restoring the diseased coronary artery to its natural state. The BVS compensates for its decreased radial strength by having thicker struts that could cause disturbed blood flow, resulting in delayed healing and other devastating complications. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations had been used to analyze the potential risk of the BVS, but those simulations were conducted on either arbitrary geometry or partially patient-specific geometry with overly smoothed or virtually deployed stents. In this thesis, we present a novel methodology to reconstruct true patient-specific CFD simulations: the geometry of a deployed stent inside a living patient is reconstructed from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images; the shape and the curvature of the stented vessel are obtained from angiography; and a real pulsatile flow rate profile can also be prescribed as inflow condition, when it is available. With patient-specific geometry, the CFD results reflect the true hemodynamics after stent deployment and describe the wall shear stress (WSS) and other quantities. We also aim to make the reconstruction and simulation process automatic, so that a large number of patients can be processed in a short time in order to draw statistically convincing conclusions. In fact, the entire process of the computational patient-specific analysis is expected to become a routine in clinical trials and activities (Computer Aided Clinical Trials, CACT). This has created significant challenges in the methodological approach, ranging from image analysis, image processing, computational geometry and eventually fluid dynamics. These work witnesses the different challenges of this multi-component procedure. We hope the patient-specific reconstruction and simulations study can further the understanding  of the BVS, improve its design, and ultimately expedite the tedious validation process so that it can soon become a soldier for us in the battle against coronary heart disease.",

        "description": "The Big Data phenomenon is posing new challenges in our modern society. In addition to requiring information systems to effectively manage high-dimensional and complex data, the privacy and social implications associated with the data collection, data analytics, and service requirements create new important research problems. First, the high volume of personal data generated by users' devices (e.g. credit card transactions, GPS trajectories from mobile devices and medical data) can be used, much like a fingerprint, to identify the person who created it with the risk of disclosing sensitive information such as: political inclination, financial status and medical condition. Second, popular social networks (e.g. Facebook, Foursquare, Yelp) not only enable users to share locations and preference but also create opportunities for them to establish complex interactions (e.g. forming communities, planning trip). This creates the needs for location based services to provide services to groups of users rather than individuals. In this dissertation, we present effective solutions for both these privacy and social challenges. In the privacy domain, we propose new privacy preserving techniques to provide individual users with formal guarantee of privacy while at the same time preserve meaningful information of the data released. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solutions in different domains such as: sequential pattern mining, record linkage, and computation of statistics over data streams. In the social domain, we propose a new type of group query aiming to find a route that all users can traverse while maximizing the group preference for the locations jointly visited. The ability of solving such query can greatly benefit many existing and emerging tools that allow users to share route information (e.g. Uber, Waze) and plan group outings or trips (e.g. QuickCliqs). Extensive empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our solutions and provide us with important insights for future research directions.",

        "description": "Given a graph $G$ the \\emph{chromatic number}, denoted $\\chi(G)$, is smallest number of colors necessary to color $V(G)$ such that no adjacent vertices receive the same color.  A graph $G$ is $k$-critical if $\\chi(G)=k$ but every proper subgraph has chromatic number less than $k$. As $k$-critical graphs can be viewed as minimal examples of graphs with chromatic number $k$, it is natural to ask how small such a graph can be. Let $f_k(n)$ denote the minimum number of edges in a $k$-critical graph on $n$ vertices.  The Ore construction, used to build larger $k$-critical graphs, implies that \\[f_k(n+k-1)\\leq f_k(n)+(k-1)\\left(\\frac{k}{2}-\\frac{1}{k-1}\\right).\\] A recent paper by Kostochka and Yancey provides a lower bound for $f_k(n)$ which implies that the asymptotic density $\\phi_k:=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f_k(n)/n = \\frac{k}{2}-\\frac{1}{k-1}$. In this work, we use the method of discharging to prove a lower bound on the number of edges which includes structural information about the graph.\nThis lower bound shows that the asymptotic density of a $k$-critical graph can be increased by $\\epsilon>0$ by restricting to $(K_{k-2})$-free $k$-critical graphs.\\\\\n\\\\\nWe also prove that the graphs constructible from the Ore construction and $K_k$, called \\emph{$k$-Ore} graphs, are precisely the graphs which attain Kostochka and Yancey's bound.  Moreover, we also provide results regarding subgraphs which must exist in $k$-Ore graphs.

        "description": "In physics, it is sometimes desirable to compute the so-called Density Of States (DOS), also known as the spectral density, of a Hermitian\nmatrix A. The spectral density can be viewed as a probability density distribution that measures the likelihood of finding eigenvalues near\nsome point on the real line. The most straightforward way to obtain this density is to compute all eigenvalues. But this approach is generally  costly and wasteful, especially for matrices of large dimension.  In many cases, the only affordable operation is matrix-vector\nmultiplication. In this talk I will define the problem of estimating the spectral density carefully, and discuss a few known algorithms based on stochastic sampling, in particular, those using the kernel polynomial method and the Lanczos method, for estimating the spectral density.  The accuracy of stochastic algorithms converge as $O(1\\sqrt{N_v})$, where $N_v$ is the number of stochastic vectors.  I will also talk about recent progresses of stochastic estimation of spectral densities with convergence rate much faster than $O(1\\sqrt{N_v})$ using a relatively high degree of polynomials and modest choice of $N_v$.

Efficient analysis of EHRs can help address\nmany healthcare problems by improving clinical decisions, facilitating\nknowledge discoveries, and enabling the development of cost-effective\ntreatment and management programs. However, EHRs pose many formidable\nchallenges for traditional analytics. The data are collected across\ndiverse populations, consist of heterogeneous and noisy information,\nand have varying time resolutions. Moreover, healthcare professionals\nare unaccustomed to interpreting high-dimensional EHRs; they prefer\nconcise medical concepts. Thus, a major question is how to transform\nEHR into meaningful concepts with modest levels of expert guidance.\\\\\n\\\\\nIn this talk, I will discuss two approaches to extract concise,\nmeaningful concepts from certain types of health datasets.

Spatial join is widely used by many of the emerging spatial data analysis applications. However, spatial join processing on even a moderate sized dataset is very time consuming. At the same time, there is a rapid expansion in available processing cores, through multicore machines and Cloud computing. The confluence of these trends points to a need for effective parallelization of spatial query processing. Unfortunately, traditional parallel spatial databases are ill-equipped to deal with the performance heterogeneity that is common in the Cloud. In this talk I present two systems that I developed to parallelize spatial join queries in the Cloud and in a large main memory multicore machine.\\\\\n\\\\\nWith the proliferation of GPS-enabled mobile devices and sensors,  Location Based Services (LBS) have become the most prominent among the spatio-temporal applications. These applications are characterized by high rate of location updates and many concurrent short running range queries. With a large number of devices, the rate of location update can easily surpass 1 million or more updates per second. Traditional relational databases may not be well-suited for this. As the era of \"Internet of things\" approaches, this issue is expected to get accentuated.  In my talk I present a parallel in-memory spatio-temporal indexing technique to support the demands of LBS workloads. Our system achieves significantly better performance than existing approaches to indexing spatio-temporal data. I also present a parallel in-memory spatio-temporal topological join approach.

The robustness of this tool depends on the reliability of the results. Data Assimilation (DA) is a set of techniques that can help to improve the specificity of the models, by incorporating available data (e.g., measurements), making the results of the simulations patient specific. On the other hand, the numerical methods used in the simulations must be accurate enough to guarantee that the computed solution accurately describes the real behavior of the system.\\\\\n\\\\\nThis work is divided into two parts. In the first, we focus on the problem of the estimation of the compliance of a vessel using DA techniques. In particular, we use measurements of the displacement of the vessel wall to estimate its Young's modulus, and we focus on the issue of the computational costs associated with the solution of the inverse problem. The second part of this work concerns the accurate simulation of flows at moderately large Reynolds numbers. In particular, we focus on a particular discretization of the Leray system, proposing a new interpretation of the method as an operator-splitting scheme for a perturbed version of the Navier-Stokes equations, and we use heuristic arguments to calibrate one of the main parameters of the model.\\\\\n\\\\\nFor both these parts we will perform numerical experiments, on 3D geometries, to validate the approaches. In particular, for the first part, we will use synthetic measures to validate our approach, while for the second part, we will test the method on a benchmark proposed by the Food and Drug Administration, comparing out results with experimental data.",

        "description": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease resulting in motor- and movement-related impairments. A clinical diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease requires clinically detectable motor symptoms, which do not occur until six to eight years after the nigral neurons in the brain begin to degenerate. By detecting PD at an earlier stage, patients can begin therapy sooner, and consequently receive better treatment and care. Therefore, in order to detect motor defects prior to clinical detection, we developed a web-based, user-friendly computer task called Predictive Movement and Trajectory Tracking (PMATT). This task was administered to 23 PD patients and 14 normal controls while recording computer cursor movements. Using machine learning techniques, we calculated fifteen significant motor-related behavioral metrics which strongly distinguish the two groups of patients. By implementing a J48 classifier with these behavioral metrics, over 97% of subjects were correctly classified with an AUC of 0.992. From these results, we conclude that PMATT may be a helpful tool in screening for PD. Since it is easily scalable and automated for individual use, PMATT can be effortlessly administered to the general population. Furthermore, its use in research may help provide insights into the development of motor impairment in pre-clinical PD and help track symptom progression with a higher precision than is currently possible.​",

        "date": "2014-10-31",
        "description": "Support of high performance queries on large volumes of spatial data have become important in many application domains, including geowspatial problems in numerous fields, location based services, geo-social networks, and emerging scientific applications that are increasingly data- and compute-intensive. There are two major challenges for managing and querying massive spatial data: the explosion of spatial data, and the high computational complexity of spatial queries due to the multi-dimensional nature of spatial analytics. High performance computing capabilities are fundamental to efficiently handling of massive spatial datasets. MapReduce based computing model provides a highly scalable, reliable, elastic and cost effective framework for processing massive data on a cluster or cloud environment. While the MapReduce model fits nicely with large scale problems through data partitioning, spatial queries and analytics are intrinsically complex to fit into the MapReduce model easily. Meanwhile, hybrid systems combining CPUs and GPUs are becoming commonly available in commodity clusters, but the computing capacity of such systems is often underutilized. Providing new spatial querying and analytical methods to run on such architecture requires us to answer several fundamental research questions that are of practical importance. The goal of my dissertation is to create a framework with new systematic methods to support high performance spatial queries for spatial big data on MapReduce and CPU-GPU hybrid platforms, driven by real-world use cases. Towards that end, we have researched multi-level parallelism methods of spatial queries running on these platforms. Specifically, we have conducted following studies: 1) create new spatial data processing methods and pipelines with spatial partition level parallelism through a simple programming model MapReduce and propose multi-level indexing methods to accelerate spatial data processing, 2) develop two critical components to enable data parallelism: effective and scalable spatial partitioning in MapReduce (pre-processing), and query normalization methods for partition effect, 3) integrate GPU-based spatial operations into MapReduce pipelines 4) investigate optimization methods for data skew mitigation, and CPU/GPU resource coordination in MapReduce, and 5) support declarative spatial queries for workload composition, and create a query translator to automatically translate the queries into MapReduce programs. Consequently, we have developed Hadoop-GISb a MapReduce based high performance spatial querying system for spatial data warehousing. The system supports multiple types of spatial queries on MapReduce through spatial partitioning, implicit parallel spatial query execution on MapReduce, and effective methods for amending query results through handling bound- ary objects. Hadoop-GIS utilizes global partition indexing and customizable on demand local spatial indexing to achieve efficient query processing. Hadoop-GIS is integrated into Hive to support declarative spatial queries with an integrated architecture. The systems and developed approaches are released as an open source software package for use.",

        "description": "For an integer h bigger or equal to 2, a $B_h$ set is a set of integers with the property that every collection containing h of its elements yield a unique sum (and repetitions are allowed). For $h = 2$, such sets are also called Sidon sets. In this talk we will describe our recent results on estimating $F(n, s, h)$, which we define as the number of $B_h$ sets of cardinality s containing integers from $[n] = {1, 2, ..., n}$. It is not hard to see that for $s > n^(1/h)$, we have $F(n, s, h) = 0$. Indeed, in this case there are more h-sums than possible outcomes for the sums. On the other hand, there are constructions of B-h sets having cardinality $c.n^(1/h)$, (with c depending on h only) hence we shall estimate the behavior of $F(n, s, h)$ for s up to $O( n^(1/h))$.\nOur counting shows the existence of a surprising threshold function $T(n)$: for values of $s << T(n)$, the B-h sets are abundant while for $s >> T(n)$ the B-h sets become very rare. More precisely, we show that $T(n) ~ n^{(1 + o(1))/(2h - 1)}$ and establish fairly precise estimates of $F(n, s, h)$ for the entire range of s.",

We prove this first for backward Euler schemes, and then extend the results to BDF2 schemes, and finally to schemes with outflow boundary conditions. Several numerical experiments are given which verify the convergence rate, and show how using projection methods in this setting with large grad-div stabilization parameters improves accuracy.",

        "description": "Applying Diploid Method to Improve Read-mapping and Analysis Based on NGS Data\n  Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have been applied extensively in many areas of genetics and genomics research. A fundamental problem when comes to analyzing NGS data is mapping short sequencing reads back to the reference genome. Most of existing software packages rely on a single uniform reference genome and do not automatically take into the consideration of genetic variants. On the other hand, large proportions of incorrectly mapped reads affect the correct interpretation of the NGS experimental results.  In this presentation, I will talk about a method that produces a personalized diploid reference genome based on all known genetic variants of that particular individual. Using such a reference genome can improve mapping accuracy and significantly reduce the bias toward reference allele in allele-specific expression analysis. By incorporating the imputation into the diploid method, genotype calling and SNP discovery results will also be improved.",

        "description": "Analysis of user attention and Web page examination behavior, collected with specialized eye tracking equipment, has offered numerous insights about how online users examine content of the Web pages and remains a valuable tool for Web researchers and developers. Unfortunately, eye tracking technology is currently available for relatively small scale user studies, due to its high costs and the effort associated with participant recruitment. In this thesis we develop several alternatives to eye tracking for studying user attention and behavior. We start by introducing ViewSer - a method based on idea restricted focus viewing, that allows measuring attention for thousands of participants. Then, we develop a probabilistic model that infers most likely position of user’s gaze on the screen from user interactions and web page content. Our model outperforms current state of the art for gaze position prediction that only uses behavioral signals. In addition to the methodological contributions, this thesis develops several important applications in web search and medical domain. First, we describe a scalable approach for extracting frequent mouse cursor movement patterns from large scale cursor data. Second, we demonstrate how these patterns could be used to improve quality of search relevance estimation and search result ranking. Third, we show that attention measured with cursor and viewport position could be used to improve automatic summarization. Lastly, we show how restricted focus viewing could be adapted to develop an automated diagnostic of memory impairment that could be administered over the Web anywhere in the world. Together, the techniques developed and evaluated in this thesis substantially advance the state of the art and enable novel important practical applications.",

        "description": "We live in the age of big data. With an increasing number of people, devices, and sensors connected with digital networks, individual data now can be largely collected and analyzed by data mining applications for social good as well as for commercial interests. However, the data generated by individual users exhibit unique behavioral patterns and sensitive information, and therefore must be transformed prior to the release for analysis.   The AOL search log release in 2006 is an example of privacy catastrophe, where the searches of an innocent citizen were quickly re-identified by a newspaper journalist.  In this talk, I will present a novel framework to release continuous aggregation of private data for an important class of real-time data mining tasks, such as disease outbreak detection and web mining, to name a few.  The key innovation is that the proposed framework captures the underlying dynamics of the continual aggregate statistics with time series state-space models, and simultaneously adopts filtering techniques to correct the observed, noisy data.  I will show that the new framework provides a rigorous, provable privacy guarantee to individual data contributors without compromising the output analysis results.  Extensive empirical studies confirm that it will enable privacy-preserving data analytical tasks in a broad range of application domains.",

        "date": "2014-06-20",
        "description": "In hyperpsectral imaging, multiple images of the same scene are obtained over a contiguous range of wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum. Hyperspectral images represent observations of a scene at many different wavelengths and most importantly associate to each pixel in the imaged scene a full spectral vector or spectral signature. However, due to the presence of spectral mixtures (at different scales) in the scene and/or low spatial resolution of the hyperspectral sensor, the acquired spectral vectors of each pixel are actually a mixture of the spectra of the various materials present in the spatial coverage area of the corresponding pixel, and they also contain additional degradations caused by atmospheric blurring.We present a numerical approach for deblurring and sparse unmixing of space objects taken by ground based telescopes. A major challenge for deblurring hyperspectral images is that of estimating the overall blurring operator, taking into account the fact that the blurring operator point spread function (PSF) can be wavelength dependent and depend on the imaging system as well as the effects of atmospheric turbulence.  We formulate the PSF estimation as a nonlinear least squares problem, which is solved using a variable projection Gauss-Newton method. Our analysis shows that the Jacobian can be potentially very ill-conditioned. To deal with this ill-conditioning, we use a combination of subset selection and regularization.  We then incorporate the PSF estimation scheme with a preconditioned alternating direction method of multipliers to solve the deblurring and sparse unmixing problem. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the resulting numerical schemes.",

        "description": "The rapidly increasing prevalence of distributed data-driven applications has highlighted security and privacy issues in storing and processing sensitive data.  Although manipulating raw data may violate privacy of their owners, different techniques of preparing and using privacy-preserving data descriptions can be still used.  It remains a challenge, however, to ensure that adapted and new solutions are efficient, secure, and preserve privacy of data owners without disclosing confidentiality of data providers.\\\\\n\\\\\nThe dissertation proposes a new notion of $m$-privacy that addresses the challenges when data providers may act as adversaries. To verify if such adversaries are capable of breaching privacy, we introduce a few different strategies and an adaptive algorithm to select and run the most efficient approach.  In addition, we designed an algorithm to anonymize data, such that its results are $m$-private, i.e., knowing the results would not help any $m$ colluding parties in their attacks.  All verification and anonymization algorithms have been implemented to be run in distributed environments by a trusted third party.\\\\\n\\\\\nFor settings without a trusted third party, we introduce new secure multiparty computation protocols that implement centralized $m$-privacy verification and anonymization algorithms.  For each protocol, we provedits security, analyzed its communication complexity, and evaluated its overall performance for various settings.\\\\\n\\\\\nThe dissertation also describes a new algorithm to build differentially private histograms for records with customized privacy levels.  The algorithm has two data partitioning phases (privacy-driven and data-driven).  In addition, we adapted a v-optimal partitioning algorithm to be used with differential privacy, and experimentally evaluated their performance. \\\\\n\\\\\nFinally, the dissertation presents a new differential privacy mechanism that achieves collusion resistance in distributed environments with\nsmall overhead.  We also defined an enhanced fault tolerant secure scheme (EFT), which can be used to design a variety of secure multiparty aggregation operations, and we employed it to implement our differential privacy mechanism in distributed environments.  Both, the privacy mechanism and the EFT scheme have been extensively analyzed and experimentally evaluated.",

        "description": "Coupling scientific applications to heterogeneous computational targets requires specialized expertise and enormous manual effort. To simplify the deployment process, we propose a novel adaptive approach that helps execute unmodified applications on raw computational resources. Our method is based on situation-specific “adapter” middleware that builds up target capabilities to fulfill application requirements, avoiding homogenization that may conceal platform-specific features. We investigate three dimensions of adaptation: performance, execution paradigm, and software deployment and propose the ADAPT framework as a methodology and a toolkit that automates execution-related tasks. For parallel applications, ADAPT matches logical communication patterns to physical interconnect topology and improves execution performance by reducing use of long-distance connections. In a proof-of-concept demonstration of application–platform paradigm transformation, ADAPT enables execution of unmodified MPI applications on the Map–Reduce Platform as a Service cloud by recreating and emulating missing MPI capabilities. To facilitate software deployment, ADAPT automatically provisions resources by applying soft-install adapters that dynamically transform target capabilities to satisfy application requirements. As a result of these types of transformations, a broader spectrum of resources can smoothly execute scientific applications, which brings the notion of utility computing closer to reality.",

Stark.\n\n\nSkip Garibaldi is associate director of UCLA's Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics and a professor in Emory University's Department of Mathematics & Computer Science.  His previous work on the lottery received the Lester R. Ford Award and is the subject of a chapter in the popular book “Brain Trust\".  Millions of people have seen him talk about math on 20/20, CNN, and Fox & Friends, and he is featured in a museum exhibit about mathematics currently on display at Exploration Place in Wichita.\n\n\nLawrence Mower is an investigative reporter with The Palm Beach Post. He joined The Post in 2013, after working for the Las Vegas Review-Journal, where his yearlong investigation into Las Vegas police shootings sparked a Department of Justice investigation and led to reforms in policy and oversight. The five-part series was awarded by the National Headliner Awards, Investigative Reporters and Editors, and the ACLU of Nevada, and in 2012 he was named Nevada's Outstanding Journalist by the Nevada Press Association. He is a 2006 graduate of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.",

For example, the $n$th Fourier coefficient of Klein's $j(\\tau)$ function is the dimension of the grade $n$ part of a special infinite dimensional representation $V$ of the monster group. Similar phenomena have been shown to hold for the Matthieu group $M_{24}$, but instead of modular functions, mock modular forms must be used.  This has been conjecturally generalized even further, to umbral moonshine, which associates to each of 23 Niemeier lattices a finite group, infinite dimensional representation, and mock modular form.  We use generalized Borcherds products to relate monstrous moonshine and umbral moonshine.  Namely, we show that twisted traces of classical moonshine functions are equal to coefficients of umbral mock modular forms.  We also show that certain umbral coefficients have $p$-adic properties.",

Well-written documents are obviously more valuable to users.  While spelling and grammar errors are detected easily by current systems, there are numerous other aspects of writing quality for which computational methods do not exist. I will outline some models I have built to predict coherent, concise and popular writing style. \n\nSecond I will describe some ongoing work to automatically uncover the structure of and summarize conversations from web discussion forums. Often forums are organized as threads with posts appearing in a simple chronological order. I will describe two models which add more structure to these conversations:  one which groups forum participants based on the content and reply patterns of their conversations, and a second model to identify easy and difficult instructions suggested in computer troubleshooting forums.",

        "description": "The recent increase in the production pace of functional genomics data has created new opportunities in understanding regulation. Advances range from the identification of new regulatory elements, to the prediction of gene expression from genomic and epigenomic features. At the same time, this data-rich environment has raised challenges in retrieving and interpreting information from these data.\\\\\n\\\\\nBased on recent algorithmic developments, deep artificial neural networks (ANN) have been used to  build  representations of the input that preserve only the information needed to the task at hand. Prediction models  based on these representations have achieved excellent results in machine learning competitions.  The deep learning paradigm describes methods for building these representations and training the prediction models in a single learning exercise.\\\\\n\\\\\nIn this work, we propose ANN as tools for modeling gene regulation and a novel technique for interpreting what the model has learned.\\\\\n\\\\\nWe implement software for the design of ANNs and for training practices over functional genomics data. As a proof of concept, use our software to model differential gene expression during cell differentiation. To show the versatility of ANNs, we train a regression model on measurements of protein-DNA interaction to predict gene expression levels.\\\\\n\\\\\nTypically, input feature extraction from a trained ANN is formulated as an optimization problem whose solution is slow to obtain and not unique. We propose a new efficient technique for classification problems that provides guarantees on the class probability of the features and their norm. We use this technique to identify input features used by the trained model in classification and show how these features agree with previous empirical studies.\\\\\n\\\\\nFinally, we propose building representations of functional features from protein-DNA interaction measurements using a deep stack of nonlinear transformations.  We train the model on a small portion of the input and compute small dimensional representations for the rest of the genome. We show that these reduced representations are informative and can be used to label parts of the gene, regulatory elements, and quiescent regions.\\\\\n\\\\\nWhile widely successful, deep ANNs are considered to be hard to use and interpret. We hope that this work will help  increase the adoption of such models in the genomics community.",

        "date": "2014-03-27",
        "description": "Starting from the fundamental laws of filtration and transport in biological tissues, we develop a mathematical model able to capture the interplay between blood perfusion, fluid exchange with the interstitial volume, mass transport in the capillary bed, through the capillary walls and into the surrounding tissue. These phenomena are accounted at the microscale level, where the capillary bed and the interstitial volume are viewed as two separate regions. The capillary bed is described as a network of vessels carrying blood flow.\nWe complement the model with a state of art numerical solver, based on the finite element method. The numerical scheme is based on the idea to represent the capillary bed as a network of one-dimensional channels that acts as a concentrated source of flow immersed into the interstitial volume, because of the natural leakage of capillaries. As a result, it can be classified as an embedded multiscale method.\nWe apply the model to study drug delivery to tumors. Owing to its general foundations, the model can be adapted to describe and compare various treatment options. In particular, we consider drug delivery from bolus injection and from nanoparticles, which are in turn injected into the blood stream. The computational approach is prone to perform a systematic quantification of the treatment performance, enabling the analysis of interstitial drug concentration levels, drug metabolization rates, cell surviving fractions and the corresponding timecourses. Our study suggests that for the treatment based on bolus injection, the drug dose is not optimally delivered to the tumor interstitial volume. Using nanoparticles as intermediate drug carriers overrides the shortcomings of the previous delivery approach.\nBeing directly derived from the fundamental laws of flow and transport, the model relies on general foundations and it is prone to be extended in different directions. On one hand, we are planning to combine it with a poroelastic description of the interstitial tissue, in order to capture the interplay of mechanical deformations and transport phenomena. On the other hand, the model may be adapted in future to study different types of cancer, provided that suitable metrics are available to quantify the transport properties of a specific tumor mass.",

The best methods for estimating these evolutionary histories, or phylogenetic trees, are based on NP-hard optimization problems, and thus phylogenetic analyses of large-scale datasets is extremely computationally intensive. The continually diminishing costs and increasing throughput of DNA sequencing technologies will lead to an ever greater demand for methods capable of producing accurate phylogenetic trees on complex, large-scale molecular datasets. In this talk, I will describe algorithms my collaborators and I have developed to address this demand.\n\n\nI will present SuperFine and ASTRAL, two divide-and-conquer approaches with desirable  theoretical properties and excellent empirical performance. Both methods are supertree approaches in that they divide a larger taxon set into subsets, estimate trees on those subsets, and apply a supertree method which assembles a tree on the entire set of taxa from the smaller \"source\" trees. SuperFine is designed to handle datasets with source tree conflict only due to estimation error, while\nASTRAL is designed to handle source tree conflict due to estimation error and incomplete lineage sorting which can cause gene trees to differ from the underlying species tree.\n\n\nI will present supertree methods in a mathematical context, focusing on some theoretical properties of MRP (Matrix Representation with Parsimony), the most popular supertree method, and SuperFine which outperforms MRP.

Public sentiments in debates, blogs, and news comments are crucial to governmental agencies for passing new bills/policies, gauging social unrest, predicting elections, and socio-economic indices. The goal of my research is to build robust statistical models for opinion mining with applications to marketing, social, and behavioral sciences. To achieve this goal, a number of research challenges need to be addressed. The first challenge is fine-grained information extraction which can capture diverse types of opinions (e.g., agreement/disagreement; contention/controversy, etc.) and various other latent sentiments expressed in social conversations and discussions. The state-of-the-art machinery (e.g., topic modeling) falls short for such a task. I develop several novel knowledge induced sentiment topic models which respect notions of human semantics. The second challenge is that social sentiments are inherently dynamic and change over time. To leverage the sentiments over time for predictive analytics (e.g., predicting financial markets), I develop Bayesian nonparametric topic based sentiment time-series and vector autoregression models. The third challenge is to filter deceptive opinion spam/fraud. It is estimated that 15-20% opinions on the Web are fake. Hence, detecting opinion spam is a precondition for reliable opinion mining.\n\nIn this talk, I will present novel statistical models for sentiment analysis and talk about two key frameworks: (1) Semi-supervised graphical models for mining fine-grained opinions in social conversations, and (2) Bayesian nonparametrics, sentiment time-series, and vector autoregression models for stock market prediction.\n\nIn the later part of the talk, I will discuss the problem of opinion spam and throw light on some techniques for filtering opinion spam.

The first part introduces a scalable and owner-centric secure data sharing scheme, where owners can cryptographically enforce fine-grained data access control on any untrusted server by specifying access policies based on attributes of the data itself and authorized users, which is achieved by adapting a new cryptographic primitive called attribute-based encryption.

Selectional branching is guaranteed to perform faster than beam search yet performs as accurately.

In particular, the big data revolution heavily depends on our ability to use statistical machine learning methods to make sense of the large amounts of data we have. Research in Natural Language Processing has both benefited and contributed to the advancement of machine learning and inference methods. However multiple problems still hinder the broad application of some of these methods.  Performance Degradation of machine learning based systems in domains other than the training domain is one of the key problems hindering widespread deployment of these systems.\\\\\n\\\\\nIn this talk, I will present techniques for domain adaptation \"on the fly\", that allows adaptation to test domains using the same model from training domain. This is accomplished by  transforming text from the test domain to look more like the training domain and running the same model from the training domain. This process of text adaptation treats the model as black box, thus makes the adaptation of complex pipelines of models easy and flexible. The next key challenge for machine learning is the processing of vast amounts of data in an efficient manner. Prediction problems for tools are often complicated, for natural language processing and other disciplines, making application of these tools to big data infeasible. The later part of the talk will focus on improving the scalability of machine learning tools with complex prediction component to meet the challenges of big data. \nI will show how it is possible to amortize the cost of prediction over the lifetime of any machine learning tool. Particularly, I will focus on amortizing integer linear programs which can represent a wide variety of prediction problems. I will present exact and approximate theorems for speeding up the solution time of new integer programs by reusing solutions of previously solved integer programs.\\\\\n\\\\\nGourab Kundu is a doctoral candidate in Computer Science Department of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, supervised by Prof. Dan Roth.

By enforcing properly designed structured sparsity, we can integrate the specific data structures and domain knowledge into the machine learning models to simplify data models and discover predictive patterns in big data analytics. Big Data research is accelerating the translation of biological and biomedical data to advance the detection, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of diseases, including the recently announced BRAIN (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) Initiative. To address the challenging problems in current big data mining, we proposed several novel large-scale structured sparse learning models for multi-dimensional data integration, heterogeneous multi-task learning, group/graph structured data analysis, and longitudinal feature learning. We applied our new structured sparse learning models to analyze the multi-modal neuroimaging and genome-wide array data in Imaging Genomics and discover the phenotypic and genotypic biomarkers to characterize the neurodegenerative process in the progression of Alzheimer’s disease and other complex brain disorders. We also utilized our new machine learning models to analyze the Electronic Medical Records for predicting the heart failure patients’ readmission and drug side effects, detect the multi-dimensional biomarkers in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) research, and identify the brain circuitry patterns in Human Connectome.",

        "description": "In this talk, we discuss an integrated Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) modeling framework for human decision making, whose sub-modules are based on Bayesian belief network, Decision-Field-Theory, and probabilistic depth first search technique.  A key novelty of the proposed model is its ability to represent both the human decision-making and decision-planning functions in a unified framework.  In this talk, the proposed modeling framework is demonstrated for human’s evacuation behaviors under a terrorist bomb attack situation.  To mimic realistic human behaviors, attributes of the BDI framework are reverse-engineered from the human-in-the-loop experiments conducted in the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) available at The University of Arizona.  A crowd simulation is then constructed, where individual human behaviors are based on what was learned from the CAVE experiments.  In this work, the simulated environment and humans conforming to the proposed BDI framework are implemented in AnyLogic® agent-based simulation software, where each human entity calls external Netica BBN software to perform its perceptual processing function and Soar software to perform its real-time planning and decision-execution functions.  The constructed crowd simulation is then used to test impact of several factors (e.g. demographics of people, number of policemen, information sharing via speakers) on evacuation performance (e.g. average evacuation time, percentage of casualties).  Finally, we discuss other emergency evacuation applications (e.g. evacuation behaviors under fire in a factory) and research extensions for the proposed BDI framework.",

Accurately extracting significant events from large volumes of text informs the government, companies and the public regarding possible changing circumstances caused or implied by events. \\\\\n\\\\\nExtracting event information completely and accurately is challenging mainly due to the high complexity of discourse phenomena. In this talk, I will present two discourse-guided event extraction architectures that explore evidence and clues from wider discourse to seek out or validate pieces of event descriptions. TIER is a multilayered event extraction architecture that performs text analysis at multiple granularities to progressively \"zoom in\" on relevant event information. LINKER is a more principled discourse-guided approach that models textual cohesion properties in a single structured sentence classifier.\\\\\n\\\\\nFinding documents that describe a specific type of event is also challenging because of the wide variety and ambiguity of event expressions. I will focus on the recent multi-faceted event recognition approach that uses event defining characteristics (facets), in addition to event expressions, to effectively resolve the complexity of event descriptions.

As a concrete example, large-scale in-memory object caches like memcached are now widely used to accelerate popular web sites and to reduce burden on backend databases. Yet operators still have limited visibility into how these caches should be set up to optimally accommodate the workloads they see. How much would the cache performance improve from additional cache space, or by adding more cache servers to the pool? Since resources come at a cost, to what extent would request latencies deteriorate if cache memory were repurposed for a different service?\\\\\n\\\\\nIn this talk, I'll focus on some of the latest research questions pertaining to scalable data replication and large-scale distributed caches. In particular, I'll home in on the challenge of providing online monitoring of the cost and benefits of memory space in a large-scale cache, enabling cache operators to answer the questions above without requiring extraneous trace collection and manual offline tuning. I will introduce general and efficient algorithms for dynamically estimating hit rate curves -- histograms of cache hit rate as a function of memory size -- which can be plugged into cache replacement policies such as LRU.\\\\\n\\\\\nExtensive simulations on cache benchmarks indicate that these methods provide accurate estimates of hit rate at different cache sizes. Experiments on an implementation of these methods in memcached showed that hit rate curves were dynamically estimated at over 98% accuracy with only a small drop in throughput. The results are encouraging and suggest that exposing hit rate curves can be a practical method for improving provisioning and metering of large-scale data caches.",

For a system with N electrons, the standard method for solving KSDFT requires solving N eigenvectors for an $O(N) * O(N)$ Kohn-Sham  Hamiltonian matrix.  The computational cost for such procedure is expensive and scales as $O(N^3)$.  We have developed pole expansion plus selected inversion (PEXSI) method, in which KSDFT is solved by evaluating the selected elements of the inverse of a series of sparse symmetric matrices, and the overall algorithm scales at most $O(N^2)$ for all materials including insulators, semiconductors and metals.  The PEXSI method can be used with orthogonal or nonorthogonal basis set, and the physical quantities including electron density, energy, atomic force, density of states, and local density of states are calculated accurately without using the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  The recently developed massively parallel PEXSI method has been implemented in SIESTA, one of the most popular electronic structure software packages using atomic orbital basis sets.  The resulting method can allow accurate treatment of electronic structure in a unprecedented scale.   We demonstrate the application of the method for solving graphene-like structures with more than 30,000 atoms, and the method can be efficiently parallelized 10,000 - 100,000 processors on Department of Energy (DOE) high performance machines.",

A series of classical theorems, mostly due to Raynaud, give two ways of calculating the component group of the Jacobian J of X: one using the intersection matrix on the special fiber of the model of X, and the other using cycles on its incidence graph G.  These calculations can be interpreted in terms of divisors on G (in the sense of Baker-Norine) and the uniformization theory of G, respectively.  If K is complete and non-Archimedean but not discretely valued, these theorems are no longer applicable, as Néron models do not exist in this situation.  Replacing the component group with the skeleton of J (in the sense of Berkovich), a principally polarized real torus canonically associated to J, and the incidence graph with a skeleton Gamma of X, a metric graph, we will prove \"continuous\" analogues of these theorems.  Specifically, we will show that the Jacobian of Gamma is canonically identified with the skeleton of J as principally polarized real tori, in a way that is compatible with the descriptions of the two Jacobians in terms of divisors and in terms of uniformizations.  As a consequence, we will show that, when K is algebraically closed, essentially any piecewise-linear function on Gamma is the restriction to Gamma of $-\\log |f|$, where f is a nonzero rational function on X.",

Gille provided the first example of a quadratic form of trivial discriminant whose associated adjoint group is non-rational. In this talk we give a recursive construction to produce examples of $k_n$-quadratic forms $q_n$ in the n-th power of the fundamental ideal in the Witt ring whose corresponding adjoint groups PSO($q_n$) are not (stably) rational.",

That said, often a simple hierarchical model is insufficient for modeling observations since real data tends to be more nuanced in some aspects rather than others. In other words, descriptions work best if they allow for variable depth and refined descriptions. Models such as the nested Chinese Restaurant Franchise address these issues.

        "description": "Cloud computing is envisioned as the next generation architecture of IT enterprises, which provides convenient remote access to massively scalable data storage and application services. Despite the cloud’s promise for huge potential economical savings, its benefits may not be fully realized, due to wide public concerns that users’ private data may be involuntarily exposed to or mishandled by the cloud providers. Although end-to-end encryption has been proposed as a promising solution for secure cloud data storage, how to effectively support flexible data utilization such as searches over encrypted cloud data becomes a primary challenge, which is the key toward building full-fledged privacy-assured cloud data storage.\nIn this talk, I will first identify the system requirements and challenges in privacy-preserving searchable outsourced cloud data services, that is to simultaneously achieve privacy assurance (data and query confidentiality), practical efficiency (scalable with large volumes of data), and high usability (flexible query functionalities). Among these goals, privacy and the other two are often in conflict with each other and our research aims at finding a better tradeoff. As an example, I will present our recent work on privacy-preserving multi-keyword ranked search supporting similarity-based ranking. The proposed approach integrates novel cryptographic primitives with information-retrieval principles and efficient data structures. A “best-effort” privacy model is adopted while much faster-than-linear search time is achieved in an empirical sense. Finally, I will outline some future challenges that need to be resolved to make privacy-preserving searchable cloud data service a reality.\\\\\n\\\\\nBio:\\\\\nMing Li is an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Utah State University.

Both of these results are implied by the\nfollowing more general result of Thomassen: For every surface, there exist\nonly finitely many 4-critical graphs of girth at least five embeddable on\nthat surface.\n\nDvorak, Kral and Thomas provided a discharging proof of Thomassen's\ntheorem to prove a stronger result that the number of vertices in such\ngraphs is  linear in genus.

        "description": "The problem of determining the distribution of the 2-Selmer ranks of quadratic twists of an elliptic curve has received a great deal of recent attention, both in works conjecturing distributions and in those providing solutions; in both cases, the nature of the two-torsion of the elliptic curve plays a cruical role.  In particular, if $E/\\mathbb{Q}$ has full two-torsion, the distribution is known, due to work of Heath-Brown, Swinnerton-Dyer, and Kane, and if $E$ possesses no two-torsion, then, again, the distribution is known, due to work of Klagsbrun, Mazur, and Rubin, though with the caveat that one arranges discriminants in a non-standard way.  In stark contrast to these two cases, we show that if $K$ is a number field and $E/K$ is an elliptic curve with partial two-torsion, then no limiting distribution on 2-Selmer ranks exists.  We do so by showing that, for any fixed integer $r$, at least half of the twists of $E$ have 2-Selmer rank greater than $r$, and we establish an analogous result for simultaneous twists, either for multiple elliptic curves twisted by the same discriminant or for a single elliptic curve twisted by a tuple of discriminants.  These results depend upon connecting the 2-Selmer rank of twists to the values of an additive function and then establishing results analogous to the classical Erd\\H{o}s-Kac theorem.

It works by decomposing the given signal into a set of\nharmonic atoms, and then grouping those atoms into individual notes. HMP has shown very\npromising results, but more research has been needed for one case: when multiple notes with\nrational frequency relation are played simultaneously. This situation is called the overlapping\npartial problem, and it is very common in music, occurring in intervals such as major thirds,\nperfect fourths, and perfect fifths. A few solutions have been proposed to handle this over-\nlapping partial problem by performing post-processing on the output of HMP (notably HMP\nwith Spectral Smoothness (HMP SS)). In this paper, I propose an algorithm called Linear\nMatching Pursuit (LMP) to solve the overlapping partial problem of automatic note detection,\nwhich uses new heuristics to solve the problem with no post-processing required. LMP's run-\ntime is independent of the number of notes present in a given audio signal, unlike HMP.

Both subjects involve finding substructures within graphs, or\ngeneralize graphs, under certain conditions.  This dissertation\ninvestigates the following problems in each of these subjects.\\\\\n\\\\\nWe consider an extremal problem regarding multigraphs with edge\nmultiplicity bounded by a positive integer $q$.  The number $a$,\n$0 \\leq a < q$ is a jump for $q$ if, for any positive $e$, any integer\n$m$, and any $q$-multigraph on $n > n_0(e,a)$ vertices and at least\n$(a + e)(n(n-1)/2)$ edges, counting multiplicity, there is a subgraph on\n$m$ vertices and at least $(a+ c)(m(m-1)/2)$ edges, where $c = c(a)$\ndoes not depend on $e$ or $m$.  The Erd\\H{o}s-Stone theorem implies that\nfor $q=1$ every $a \\in [0,1)$ is a jump.  The problem of determining the\nset of jumps for $q \\geq 2$ appears to be much harder.  In a sequence of\npapers by Erd\\H{o}s, Brown, Simonovits and separately Sidorenko, the\nauthors established that every $a$ is a jump for $q = 2$ leaving the\nquestion whether the same is true for $q \\geq 3$ unresolved.  A later\nresult of R\\\"{o}dl and Sidorenko gave a negative answer, establishing\nthat for $q \\geq 4$ some values of $a$ are not jumps.  The problem of\nwhether or not every $a \\in [0,3)$ is a jump for $q = 3$ has remained\nopen.  We give a partial positive result in this dissertation, proving\nthat every $a \\in [0,2)$ is a jump for all $q \\geq 3$.  Additionally, we\nextend the results of R\\\"{o}dl and Sidorenko by showing that, given any\nrational number $r$ with $0 < r \\leq 1$, that $(q - r)$ is not a jump\nfor any $q$ sufficiently large.

        "description": "In digital tomosynthesis imaging, multiple projections of an object are obtained along a small range of incident angles in order to reconstruct a pseudo 3D representation of the object. This technique is of relevant interest in breast cancer screening since it eliminates the problem of tissue superposition that reduces clinical performance in standard mammography. The challenge of this technique is that it is computationally and memory intensive, as it deals with millions of input pixels in order to produce a reconstruction composed of billions of voxels. Standard approaches to solve this large-scale inverse problem have relied on simplifying the physics of the image acquisition model by considering the x-ray beam to be monoenergetic, thus decreasing the number of degrees of freedom and the computational complexity of the solution. However, this approach has been shown to introduce beam hardening artifacts to the reconstructed volume. Beam hardening occurs when there is preferential absorption of low-energy photons from the x-ray by the object, thus changing the average energy of the x-ray beam.\\\\\n\\\\\nThis thesis presents an interdisciplinary collaboration to overcome the mathematical, computational, and physical constraints of standard reconstruction methods in digital tomosynthesis imaging. We begin by developing an accurate polyenergetic mathematical model for the image acquisition process and propose a stable numerical framework to iteratively solve the nonlinear inverse problem arising from this model. We provide an efficient and fast implementation of the volume reconstruction process that exploits the parallelism available on the GPU architecture. Under our framework, a full size clinical data set can be reconstructed in under five minutes. The implementation presented reduces storage and communication costs by implicitly storing operators and increasing kernel functionality. We show that our reconstructed volume has no beam hardening artifacts and has better image quality than standard reconstruction methods. Our reconstructions also provide a quantitative measure for each voxel of the volume, allowing the physician to see and measure the contrast between materials present inside the breast. The research presented in this thesis shows that large-scale medical imaging reconstructions can be done using physically accurate models by effectively harnessing the multi-threading power of GPUs.",

For many years it was unknown whether the Magnus representation of the Torelli group is faithful.  In recent years there have been many developments on this front including the result of Church and Farb that the kernel of the Magnus representation, denoted $Mag(S)$, is infinitely generated.  I show that, not only is $Mag(S)$ highly non-trivial but that it also has a rich structure as a group. Specifically, I define an infinite filtration of $Mag(S)$ by subgroups, called the higher order Magnus subgroups, $M_n$.  I show that for each n the quotient $M_n/M_n+1$ is infinitely generated. To do this, I define a Johnson type homomorphism on each higher order Magnus subgroup quotient and show it has a highly non-trivial image.",

To sample equilateral polygon space, current algorithms use a Markov process which randomly \"folds'' polygons while preserving closure and edgelengths.

We can directly sample\nthe Stiefel manifold in O(n) time, allowing us to generate closed polygons using the pushforward map.\n\nWe will give some explicit computations of expected values for geometric properties for such random polygons, discuss their topology, and compare our theorems to numerical experiments using our sampling algorithm.

        "description": "Analytic number theory was borne out of the desire to understand the distribution of the primes.  In particular, much of modern analytic number theory can trace its origins to Riemann's seminal 1859 memoir, in which he outlines an attack on the prime number theorem by means of the study of the zeros of what we now call the Riemann zeta function.  This approach has been fruitful, and has given rise to a lot of beautiful mathematics, but this hides the dirty truth of analytic number theory: what we can prove, and what we believe to be true, are incredibly far apart.  What's more, the best known zero-free region is more than fifty years old.  In other words, analytic number theory is in dire need of new ideas.  The pretentious view of analytic number theory, as put forward by Granville and Soundararajan, is an attempt at doing this; it is analytic number theory without zeros of L-functions and without analytic continuation.  As a substitute, Granville and Soundararajan propose a general study of multiplicative functions, with the goal being to obtain deep structure theorems from which arithmetic results arise as corollaries; as such, it can be seen as finally establishing the context for the elementary proof of the prime number theorem developed by Erdos and Selberg.  In this talk, we ask about the structure of functions exhibiting more cancellation than they have a right to.  We are able to completely classify such functions in a natural setting, and we establish the right context to consider this question pretentiously.  Moreover, as pretentiousness is still a young theory, we outline our vision of what the future holds and what we believe to be the major outstanding questions.\n\n\nThis talk is a practice job talk, so feedback would be greatly appreciated.",

Do they play a central role in modular\norganization of the protein interaction network? Are they more evolutionarily\nconserved? Are there structural properties that characterize hub proteins?\n\nI will then present recently developed algorithms for identifying groups of\nhighly connected proteins, or complexes, that are evolutionary conserved.\nGiven the networks of two organisms, the algorithms uncover sub-networks of\nproteins that relate in biological function and topology of interactions.\nThe discovered conserved sub-networks have a general topology and need not\nto correspond to specific interaction patterns, so that they more closely\nfit the models of functional complexes proposed in the literature.",

A future effort aims to integrate seismic tomography, InSAR and deformation model to make the fictional holographic projector known as Virgil in the film \"Supervolcano\" a reality. We are also collaborating with Cornell and UC Berkerley to investigate several key aspects of a computation and information foundation of the smart grids in a NSF CPS project. We are studying distributed demand and response algorithms and designing an open and scalable experimental platform for smart grid, known as SmartGridLab, that integrates a hardware testbed with a software emulator, allowing software virtual nodes to interact with physical nodes in the testbed. We also discusses several research opportunities on smart environments, with the goal of enabling smart healthcare and ambient intelligence.",

        "description": "Truly distributed matrix computations with randomized communication schedules, such as gossip-based algorithms, can offer many\nattractive properties. Due to their randomized communication restricted only to direct neighbors they are\nvery flexible with respect to the underlying hardware infrastructure. They can operate on arbitrary topologies and they can be made\nresilient against dynamic changes in the network, against message loss or node failures, and against asynchrony between compute nodes. Moreover, their overall cost can be reduced by accuracy-communication\ntrade-offs. Such properties are attractive especially for loosely-coupled distributed systems with unreliable communication\nlinks, such as sensor or P2P networks. However, due to the growth in the number of nodes for future extreme-scale HPC systems and the anticipated decrease in reliability, some properties of gossip-based distributed algorithms may become important also for future HPC systems.\n\nWe are investigating distributed algorithms for various prototypical matrix computation problems which utilize gossip-based aggregation algorithms for performing reduction operations in a distributed manner. Questions addressed relate to the (communication) cost paid for the increased flexibility and robustness, to convergence properties, to numerical accuracy achieved, as\nwell as to the benefits of accuracy-communication cost trade-offs.",

        "description": "Accurate and effective methods for the numerical solution of incompressible fluid dynamics is an old but still important challenging problem, as more and more complex problems in engineering biology, ecology, medicine, sport are tackled with computational methods.\\\\\n\\\\\nIn this dissertation defense, we investigate efficient solvers for two important models that governs the motion of a fluid, the incompressible Navier-Stokes and the Brinkman equations. The former describes the motion of an incompressible fluid in either an open or closed domain. The latter is used for describing the dynamics in a matrix of an inhomogeneous porous media, alternating bubbles and open channels.\\\\\n\\\\\nFor the solution of the unsteady Navier-Stokes Equations, we move from the pressure correction algebraic factorization formerly proposed by Saleri, Veneziani (2005). These schemes feature an intrinsic hierarchical nature, such that an accurate approximation of the pressure Schur complement is obtained by computing intermediate low-order guesses. The difference between the pressure at two successive correction steps provides a natural a-posteriori estimator for time adaptivity with no additional computational cost. \\\\\n\\\\\nFor the solution of the Brinkman Equations, we follow the approach presented in Mardal, Winther (2011) to precondition symmetric saddle point problems in a Hilbert settings. More specifically, we first present a novel mixed formulation of the Brinkman problem, with improved stability properties, in which we introduce the flow's vorticity as additional unknown. Based on stability analysis of the problem in the H(curl) - H(div) - L2 norms, we derive a scalable block diagonal preconditioner which is optimal in the constant coefficient case.\\\\\n\\\\\nAlgorithms and preconditioners analysed in this thesis have been implemented in a parallel C++ code, using the finite element libraries LifeV and MFEM, and the linear algebra libraries Trilinos and HYPRE.\nWe emphasize the performance of the proposed algorithms in solving problems of practical interest, involving complex geometries and realistic flow conditions. Numerical experiments in 2D and 3D confirm the effectiveness of our approach showing good efficiency and parallel scalability properties of the solvers proposed.",

Here we consider three different topics:\nthe numerical solution of Markov chains, ranking of genes, and parallel computations with large scale-free graphs.\\\\\n\\\\\nFirst, additive Schwarz methods are a class of domain decomposition methods that are suitable for the solution of large linear systems in serial as well as in parallel mode. We adapt the Restricted Additive Schwarz (RAS) method to the computation of the stationary probability distribution\nvector of large, sparse, irreducible stochastic matrices. The convergence properties are analyzed and extensive numerical experiments aimed at assessing the effect of\nvarying the number of subdomains and the choice of overlap are discussed.\\\\\n\\\\\nNext, the ranking of genes plays an important role in the identification of key genes for a specific disease. A modification of the PageRank algorithm that is used to rank web pages is the GeneRank algorithm. We assessed the performance of additive Schwarz methods as well as a Chebyshev iteration for the solution of the GeneRank problem.\\\\\n\\\\\nFinally, many large networks are scale-free. That is, the degree distribution follows a power-law.  Currently available graph partitioners are not efficient for such an irregular degree distribution. The lack of a good partitioning leads to excessive inter-processor communication requirements during every matrix-vector multiplication on parallel distributed-memory computers. We present an approach to alleviate this problem based on embedding the original irregular graph into a more regular one by disaggregating (splitting up) vertices in the original graph. Even though the latter graph is larger, we are able to decrease the communication requirements considerably and improve the performance of matrix-vector multiplication.",

        "description": "Visco-plastic materials have been attracting a great amount of attention among researchers in the study of fluid flow due to their widespread presence in various fields of science. However, the efficient solution of the nonlinear partial differential equations modelling their flow poses many challenges. From a mathematical point of view, the major difficulty associated with solving these equations is the presence of singularities in (a priori unknown) parts of the domain. This \"irregularity\" often reflects in a slow convergence of numerical solvers. In this presentation we consider an augmented formulation of the Bingham visco-plastic flow which is aimed at circumventing the singularity of the equations. We present a nonlinear solver based on this formulation and compare its performance to other common techniques for solving the Bingham flow, indicating superior convergence properties of the solver based on the augmented formulation. Upon linearization and discretization, a sequence of linear systems is obtained which are in general very large and sparse. For the efficient solution of these linear systems we present a nonlinear geometric multilevel technique which is used to precondition a flexible Krylov subspace method. We conclude by presenting some applications of this work to problems in hemodynamics.",

For example, our ability to accurately interpret the current query can be informed by knowledge of the web pages a searcher was viewing when initiating the search or recent actions of the searcher such as queries issued, results clicked, and pages viewed. We develop a framework that enables representation of a broad variety of context including the searcher's long-term interests, recent activity, current focus, and other user characteristics. We then demonstrate how that can be used to improve the quality of search results.

Schemes which can be used \nto represent and count these floorplans, under a suitable topological equivalence, have applications in \nchip design.  A 3D mosaic floorplan is a partitioning of a box into $n$ smaller boxes.  Modern chip                 construction techniques, allowing chips with multiple layers, have fueled the desire to understand \nthe number of 3D mosaic floorplans and how to represent them.  For the 2D case, the number of unlabeled \nfloorplans with $n$ rectangles, up to topological equivalence, is exponential in $n$.  For many classes of 3D\nfloorplans the number of floorplans is also exponential.   Notable among these are 'slicing' floorplans, where to obtain an $n$ box floorplan one starts with an $n-1$ box floorplan and divides a box in two.  In this talk, \nwe discuss some of the difficulties with more general 3D floorplans, even with only two layers. In particular,\nif $F_n$ denotes the number of 3D floorplans with two levels, we show that \n$\\log F_n \\sim \\frac{1}{3}n \\log n$, and hence $F_n$ grows superexponentially in $n$.

The thesis spans three key areas in Web search, namely, understanding information needs, ranking result documents, and evaluating search experience.\\\\\n\\\\\nFirst, the thesis developed techniques for inferring the immediate searcher information needs through mining the rich interactions and context in a search session. The developed techniques improve the prediction of general search intent, commercial search intent and future ad clickthrough over the state-of-the-art methods that only exploit query and click signals.\\\\\n\\\\\nSecond, the thesis developed techniques for estimating document relevance to improve search result ranking. The Post-Click Behavior (PCB) relevance prediction model was introduced, which focuses on estimating the \"intrinsic\" document relevance from a rich set of fine-grained interactions on the viewed result documents in a search session, outperforming the state-of-theart methods that are based on the time information.\\\\\n\\\\\nThird, the thesis developed techniques for automatically evaluating search experience or search engine performance at different levels. The first level is the query-level, where techniques for predicting query performance were developed, enabling evaluation and diagnostic for particular queries or query classes. The second level is the session-level, where techniques for predicting search success were developed, which include a principled framework to study Web search success, and fine-grained interaction models that improve prediction accuracies for both desktop and mobile settings. The third level is the level of using multiple search engines, where the developed techniques focus on understanding and predicting the rationales of engine switching in a search session.",

In order to refine the Black-Scholes model, Eberlein and Keller (1995) introduced the hyperbolic Levy motion and claimed that the new model can provide a better valuation of derivative securities. We perform several statistical tests and show that the hyperbolic distributions can be well fitted to the financial data. This observation suggests us to replace the geometric Brownian motion in the Black-Scholes model by the hyperbolic Levy process and build the hyperbolic Levy pricing model. After an introduction into the Levy process theory, we attempt to numerically calculate the value of options according to the hyperbolic Levy model.",

The graphs in the set $\\mathcal{F}$ are known as {\\it forbidden subgraphs}.  The main goal of this dissertation is to further classify pairs of forbidden subgraphs that imply a 3-connected graph is hamiltonian.  First, the number of possible forbidden pairs is reduced by presenting families of graphs that are 3-connected and not hamiltonian.  Of particular interest is the graph $K_{1,3}$, also known as the {\\it claw}, as we show that it must be included in any forbidden pair.  Secondly, we show that 3-connected, $\\{K_{1,3}, N_{i,j,0}\\}$-free graphs are hamiltonian for $i,j \\ne 0, i+j \\le 9$ and 3-connected, $\\{K_{1,3}, N_{3,3,3}\\}$-free graphs are hamiltonian,  where $N_{i,j,k}$, known as the {\\it generalized net}, is the graph obtained by rooting vertex-disjoint paths of length $i$, $j$, and $k$ at the vertices of a triangle.

Since then, quite a few developments have taken place, including the study of weak approximation, descent, and torsors.\n\nIn  2005 one started using such methods to study  existence and density of integral points of affine varieties. This is what I shall report on.\n\nFor principal homogeneous spaces under   linear algebraic groups, when the groups are simply connected, we have the local-global principle, and, under some assumption of non-compactness,  we have an extension of the Chinese remainder theorem, namely strong approximation for integral points (Kneser). This has now been combined with the Brauer-Manin approach and class field theory, leading to some  control of integral points (existence and density in the completions) over  nearly arbitrary homogeneous spaces of linear algebraic groups (F. Xu and the speaker, D. Harari, M. Bororovoi, C. Demarche).\n\nBeyond the world of homogeneous spaces,  there are conjectures for affine curves (Harari and Voloch) and computations  for affine cubic surfaces (Wittenberg and the speaker). I shall thus comment on the question: which integers are sums  of three cubes of integers?\n\nI shall end the talk with a report on recent results on the integral points on some affine varieties  which admit a pencil of homogeneous spaces, but are not homogeneous spaces themselves. A concrete example is given by equations $P(t)=q(x,y,z)$ with $P(t)$ an integral  polynomial in one variable and $q(x,y,z)$ an indefinite ternary quadratic form (F. Xu and the speaker).",

        "description": "Often medical imaging systems cannot capture ideal quality images due\nto their innate acquisition speeds and patient motion. Gating methods\nhave been investigated to reduce motion artifacts, but can suffer from\ninsufficient measurements that result in low SNR\nimages. Motion-compensated image reconstruction (MCIR) methods based\non statistical iterative image reconstruction have been studied to\nimprove image quality by using all collected data and motion\ninformation so that high SNR images are reconstructed without motion\nartifacts.\n\nThis talk presents two different regularization designs for\nMCIR. First of all, we investigated methods for motion\nregularization. The usual choice for a motion regularizer in MCIR has\nbeen an elastic regularizer. Recently, there has been much research on\nregularizing nonrigid deformations with diffeomorphic motion\npriors. Conventional methods that enforce deformations to be locally\ninvertible require high computational complexity and large memory. We\ndeveloped a sufficient condition that guarantees the local\ninvertibility of B-spline deformation and proposed a simple\nregularizer based on that sufficient condition. This motion\nregularizer was applied to the motion correction using prototype\nsimultaneous PET-MR. We estimated deformable motion from\nsimultaneously acquired tagged MR volumes and incorporated it into the\nsystem matrix of unregularized OSEM algorithm for list-mode PET. We\ndemonstrated the improvement of image quality and detection task\nperformance with deformable phantom, rabbit, and small non-human\nprimate studies.\n\nSecondly, we studied the spatial resolution properties of MCIR methods\nand shows that nonrigid local motion can lead to non-uniform and\nanisotropic spatial resolution for conventional quadratic\nregularizers. This undesirable property is akin to the known effects\nof interactions between heteroscedastic loglikelihoods (e.g. Poisson\nlikelihood) and quadratic regularizers, and can cause non-uniform bias\nin small or narrow structures such as small lesions or rings of\nreconstructed images and lead to quantification errors. We proposed\nnovel spatial regularization design methods for three different MCIR\nmethods that account for known nonrigid motion.  We develop MCIR\nregularization designs that provide approximately uniform and\nisotropic spatial resolution and that match a user-specified target\nspatial resolution. 2D PET simulations demonstrate the performance and\nbenefits of the proposed spatial regularization design methods.",

        "description": "Over the past two decades, database and systems researchers have made significant advances in the development of algorithms and techniques to provide data management solutions that carefully balance the three major requirements when dealing with critical data: high availability, reliability, and data consistency. However, over the past few years the data requirements, in terms of data availability and system scalability, from Internet scale enterprises that provide services and cater to millions of users has been unprecedented. Cloud computing has emerged as an extremely successful paradigm for deploying Internet and Web-based applications. Scalability, elasticity, pay-per-use pricing, and autonomic control of large-scale operations are the major reasons for the successful widespread adoption of cloud infrastructures. In this talk, we analyze the design choices that allowed modern scalable data management systems to achieve orders of magnitude higher levels of scalability compared to traditional databases. With this understanding, we highlight some design principles for data management systems that can be used to augment existing databases with new cloud features such as scalability, elasticity, and autonomy. We then analyze several state of the art systems and discuss our proposed system, G-Store, which provides transactional guarantees on data granules formed on-demand while being efficient and scalable.\\\\\n\\\\\nBio:\nAmr El Abbadi is currently a Professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

        "description": "Patient-specific mesh generation is an important issue in computational simulations of the potential effectiveness of a medical device or the progression of a disease in a specific patient.  Many radiology applications involve movement by the patient and medical device and require dynamic meshes for use in the associated imaged-based computational simulations.  Two important examples include blood clot entrapment by inferior vena cava filters in pulmonary embolism (PE) patients and the evolution of the brain ventricles and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in hydrocephalus patients.\n\nThere are several limitations of existing dynamic meshing algorithms that make them unsuitable for use in radiology applications.  For example, the mesh warping algorithms upon which they are based often do not yield the desired volume meshes when applied to a noisy target surface mesh created from medical images of the patient.  In addition, the mesh warping algorithms are often not designed to handle the large deformations that the patient's body and the medical device undergo.  In particular, existing mesh warping algorithms sometimes yield tangled meshes with inverted elements which are invalid for use by the associated partial differential equation solver in the computational simulation.\n\nIn this talk, I will describe the image-based, parallel dynamic meshing framework for patient-specific medical interventions, which we are designing.  In particular, I will discuss two image-based meshing techninques we have developed for radiology applications.  The first algorithm I will describe is a mesh warping technique for virtual implantation of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in the venous anatomy of a PE patient. The corresponding embedded geometric models are then used in generation of non-manifold topology meshes of the embedded device and venous anatomy for use in computational fluid dynamics simulations of the blood flow, and ultimately, for improved prevention of the disease.  The second algorithm I will discuss is a combined level set/mesh warping technique for use in tracking, and, eventually, for predicting, the evolution of the deforming brain ventricles and CSF in hydrocephalus patients before and after shunt treatment.  I will conclude by describing our plans for future research in these areas.",

Kaplansky considered this problem for ternary\nforms, giving a list of 23 candidates, and proving that 19 of those represent all positive odds.\n(Jagy later dealt with a 20th candidate.) Assuming that the remaining three forms represent\nall positive odds, we prove that an arbitrary, positive-definite quadratic form represents all\npositive odds if and only if it represents the odd numbers from 1 up to 451. This result is\nanalogous to Bhargava and Hanke's celebrated 290-theorem. In addition, we prove that these\nthree remaining ternaries represent all positive odd integers, assuming the generalized Riemann\nhypothesis.\n\nThis result is made possible by a new analytic method for bounding the cusp constants of\ninteger-valued quaternary quadratic forms $Q$ with fundamental discriminant. This method is\nbased on the analytic properties of Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions, and we use it to prove that if\n$Q$ is a quaternary form with fundamental discriminant, the largest locally represented integer\n$n$ for which $Q(\\vec{x}) = n$ has no integer solutions is $O(D^{2+\\epsilon})$.",

I introduce techniques that decompose complex tasks into simpler, verifiable steps, and return crowd results in realtime.

We also explore methods to approximate the commute times and\nKatz scores from a node to all other nodes in the graph. Here, our\napproach for the commute times is based on a variation of the\nconjugate gradient algorithm, and it provides an estimate of all the\ndiagonals of the inverse of a matrix. Our technique for the Katz\nscores is based on exploiting an empirical localization property of\nthe Katz matrix.

This has motivated research on probabilistic databases, where uncertainty is modeled using probabilities, and whose goal is to deliver predictable performance for queries on large probabilistic databases. Probabilistic inference is known to be intractable in general, but once we fix a query and considers only the database as variable input, it becomes a specialized problem, which requires a specialized analysis. I will show that Unions of Conjunctive Queries (also known as non-recursive datalog rules) admit a dichotomy: every query is either provably \\#P hard, or can be evaluated in PTIME. For practical purposes, the most interesting part of this dichotomy is the PTIME algorithm, which relies on the inclusion/exclusion formula.

Basic examples of such pretheories are equivariant Chow groups, equivariant $K$-theory and equivariant algebraic cobordism.  As a new example we define an equivariant version of the cycle (co)homology with coefficients in a Rost cycle module. We also provide a version of Merkurjev's spectral sequence for equivariant cycle homology.\n\nAs an application we generalize the theorem of Karpenko-Merkurjev on $G$-torsors and rational cycles; to every $G$-torsor $E$ and a $G$-equivariant pretheory we associate a graded ring which serves as an invariant of $E$. In the case of Chow groups this ring encodes the information concerning the motivic $J$-invariant of $E$ and in the case of Grothendieck's $K_0$ it encodes the indexes of the respective Tits algebras.",

        "description": "Cardiovascular applications recently gave a strong impulse to numerical methods for fluid dynamics. Furthermore, thanks to new precise measurement devices and efficient image processing techniques, medicine is experiencing a tremendous increment of available data, inevitably affected by noise. Beyond validation, these data can be combined with numerical simulations in order to develop mathematical tools, known as data assimilation (DA) methods, of clinical impact. In the context of hemodynamics accuracy and reliability of assimilated solutions are particularly crucial in view of possible applications in the clinical routine. Hence, it is of central relevance to quantify the uncertainty of numerical results.\\\\\n\\\\\nWe propose a robust DA technique for the inclusion of noisy velocity measures, collected from magnetic resonance imaging, into the simulation of hemodynamics equations, namely the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (NSE). The technique is formulated as a control problem where a weighted misfit between velocity and data is minimized under the constraint of the NSE; the optimization problem is solved with a discretize then optimize approach relying on the finite element method. The control variable is the normal stress on the inflow section of the vessel, which is usually unknown in real applications. We design deterministic and statistical estimators (the latter based on a Bayesian approach to inverse problems) for the estimation of the blood velocity and its statistical properties and of related variables of medical relevance, such as the wall shear stress. We also derive conditions on data location that guarantee the existence of an optimal solution.\\\\\n\\\\\nNumerical simulations on 2-dimensional and axisymmetric 3-dimensional geometries show the consistency and accuracy of the method with synthetic noise-free and noisy data. Simulations on 2-dimensional geometries approximating blood vessels demonstrate the applicability of the approach for hemodynamics applications.",

Current “large aperture”  (8m-10m) telescopes will soon be eclipsed by 30m-50m behemoths.  However, as with any telescope with an aperture of more than about 0.3m, realizing the full resolving power of these telescopes requires the combined use of adaptive optics compensation and image restoration (due to turbulence in the Earth’s atmosphere). Because the characteristics of the image blur are typically unknown, blind deconvolution, where both the target object and the blurring function are estimated from the observed data, is the restoration technique of choice.\n\nI will give an overview of blind deconvolution and describe some recent advances that allow us to obtain high-quality imagery under turbulence conditions which, up until now, have been thought unsuitable for high-resolution imaging.",

A graph is called 2-factor isomorphic if all of its 2-factors are the same when viewed as a multiset of unlabeled cycles.\\\\\n\\\\\nIn this dissertation, we find the maximum size of 2-factor isomorphic graphs that contain a desired 2-factor.  We are also able to give general bounds when no 2-factor is specified or any 2-factor with a fixed number of cycles is desired.  We also find similar results for the special case where the underlying graph is bipartite.  In each case we provide constructions that attain the maximum size.",

        "date": "2011-06-06",
        "description": "Solving inverse problems is an important part of scientific computing.  As computers become more powerful, solutions to increasingly larger problems are sought, allowing for more accurate representations of real-world applications.  We consider solving large-scale inverse problems, ranging from linear to fully nonlinear.  We look at aspects common to inverse problems, such as their ill-posedness, and see how regularization can help produce meaningful results.  We discuss a number of different methods for solving while providing regularization.  One such technique is to solve using an iterative method but stop the iterations early, before convergence is fully achieved. Iterative solvers are particularly useful for large-scale inverse problems as computations can be done in parallel.  Trilinos is a mathematical software library for solving problems coming from many fields of scientific computing.  One particular package, Belos, provides both an abstract framework and concrete implementations of various iterative solvers.  We have implemented two additional solvers within the Belos framework, LSQR and MRNSD, which can be used to solve linear inverse problems.\\\\\n\\\\\nWe then consider two different case studies, where we wish to solve a large-scale linear inverse problem.  In the first study, we want to remove patient motion blur from positron emission tomography (PET) images when motion information is tracked and recorded during the scan.  We describe how this problem can be formulated as a linear equation, then we solve it using the solvers we implemented.  We also look at a number of results, seeing how the reconstruction improves as more motion information is included in our model. The second case study comes from the field of adaptive optics.  Here we wish to determine the distortion caused by the atmosphere when imaging using ground-based telescopes.  Sensors are able to obtain noisy estimates of the gradients of the distortion, resulting in a Kronecker product-structured linear least squares problem.  We describe a solving method that employs Tikhonov-type regularization by exploiting properties of the Kronecker product and utilizing the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD).  Our approach includes constructing a preconditioner off-line and then applying a few iterations of preconditioned LSQR.",

This research introduces general concepts and techniques to extend a database system with constraint processing capabilities.

        "description": "We analyze different variants of the augmented Lagrangian-based block triangular preconditioners for the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations in two and three space dimensions. Both steady and unsteady problems are considered. The preconditioners are used to accelerate the convergence of the Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES) method applied to both stable and stabilized finite element and MAC discretizations of the linearized problem. We study the eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrices obtained from Picard linearization, and we devise a simple and effective method for the choice of the augmentation parameter based on Fourier analysis. Numerical experiments on a wide range of model problems demonstrate the robustness of these preconditioners, yielding fast convergence independent of mesh size and only mildly dependent on viscosity on both uniform and stretched grids. Good results are also obtained on linear systems arising from Newton linearization. We also show that performing inexact preconditioner solves with an algebraic multigrid algorithm results in excellent scalability. Comparisons of the modified augmented Lagrangian preconditioners with other state-of-the-art techniques show the competitiveness of our approach. Implementation on parallel architectures is also considered.",

        "description": "While modern search engines perform well on easy navigational queries, every search engine user knows that there exist queries for which few or none of the top-ranked results are relevant. Such queries are commonly referred to as difficult. There are several major reasons for poor search results. In some cases, users do not have a clear information need and would simply like to explore a particular topic. In other cases, users may have a clear and specific information  need, but either cannot accurately formulate it as a keyword query (the query is too short) or their formulation is ambiguous.  Such queries are known as exploratory. Although many users are aware that the quality of search results can be improved by reformulating queries, finding a good reformulation is often non-trivial and takes time. Depending on a particular reason for poor initial retrieval results, search systems can try to engage the users into the feedback loop by generating the candidate query reformulations. In this talk, I provide an overview of three interactive feedback methods that I developed as part of my PhD thesis in order to address the specific challenges presented by difficult and exploratory queries: question feedback, sense feedback and concept feedback. Question feedback is aimed at interactive refinement of short, exploratory keyword-based queries by automatically generating and presenting to the users a list of natural language clarification questions. Sense feedback enables the users to interactively improve the quality of retrieval results by selecting the intended sense from a list of automatically generated collection-specific senses of an ambiguous query term. Concept feedback leverages the possibility of multi-step inference on the semantic network of ConceptNet to select and present to the users a small number of concepts, which are related to the original query and can be used for its expansion.\\\\",

Of course, the process of building useful models reflects a trade-off between tractability and applicability, that is, simple models are less difficult to analyze, but they may not reflect reality with sufficient accuracy. In spite of the dangers posed by oversimplification, the importance of building useful models cannot be emphasized enough. Such models will have interesting secondary implications that may or may not have been anticipated, but are nevertheless testable.

The solution to these three problems are presented on the basis of matrix functions, such as the exponential adjacency matrix. Other extensions are also mentioned.

In the first part, we consider the problem of experimental design for linear ill-posed inverse problems. The minimization of the objective function in the classic A-optimal design is generalized to a Bayes risk minimization with a sparsity constraint. We present efficient algorithms for applications of such designs to large-scale problems. This is done by employing Krylov subspace methods for the solution of a subproblem required to obtain the experiment weights. The performance of the designs and algorithms is illustrated with a one-dimensional magnetotelluric example and an application to two-dimensional super-resolution reconstruction with MRI data.\\\\\n\\\\\nIn the second part, we find the optimal regularization for linear ill-posed problems. We propose an optimal $L_2$ regularization approach enabling us to obtain inexpensive and good solutions to the inverse problem. In order to reduce the computational cost, several sparsity patterns are added to the regularization operator. Numerical experiments will show that our optimal $L_2$ regularization approach provides much better results than the traditional Tikhonov regularization.\\\\\n\\\\\nIn the last part of the thesis, we design optimal placement of sources and receivers in a $CO_2$ injection monitoring. An optimal criteria is proposed based on a target zone and different treatments for placing sources and receivers are discussed.",

Numerous success stories were reported in application areas including text clustering, computer vision, and chemometrics.\n\n In this talk, we review several NMF algorithms available in literature and present our fast algorithms for NMF and their convergence properties. Our algorithms are based on alternating nonnegative least squares (ANLS) and active-set-type methods for non-negativity constrained least squares problem. They can naturally be extended to obtain highly efficient nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) in the form of the PARAFAC (PARAllel FACtor) model, sparse NMF and NTF with L1 norm regularization.

The availability of robust and efficient solvers for this problem is an area of active interest in the nuclear engineering community and improved methods may lead to more efficient reactor designs.  In this talk we present a survey of existing numerical strategies and offer a new framework based on the Davidson eigensolver which circumvents many standard difficulties.  A multigrid-in-energy preconditioner is developed for use with the Davidson method as an alternative to the expensive matrix inversions that must typically be performed.  Numerical results using the NEWT radiation transport code provide a comparison between several leading methods and demonstrate the effectiveness of this new approach.",

Also, souls are metric invariants, so understanding how they behave under deformations of the metric is useful to analyzing the space of metrics on $M$. In particular, little is understood about the case when $M = R^2$. Convex surfaces of revolution in $R^3$ are one class of two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds of nonnegative sectional curvature, and I will discuss some results regarding the sets of souls for some of such convex surfaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n% r_h(sis $c = r \\sin \\phi,$ where $\\phi = \\angle (\\dot \\g(t), \\dot \\sigma)$ ($\\sigma$ is the meridian through $\\g(t)$.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%the intervals for integration must be broken up as follows: $[r(s_1), r(s_0)), [r(s_0,$",

However, in the real world, software developers tend to create applications that do not conform to consistent developmental practices even if they do use universal interface representations (e.g. the eXtensible Markup Language).  Our research utilizes semantic approaches, enhanced syntactical methods, and contextual information to automate the integration of software services that are developed randomly from a wide array of diverse sources. This talk discusses our foundational lines of research and subsequent contributions in the areas of service discovery, composition, and evaluation.  The talk will conclude with future work that leverages service-oriented paradigms in areas such as visual analytics, smart grid, and an “Internet of things”.",

        "description": "In physics, the moduli space of vacua for the topological N = 2 supersymmetric pure gauge theories with gauge group SO(3) is the universal elliptic curve for the modular group of level 2. Moreover, the supersymmetric gauge theory associates to each four-manifold a not necessarily holomorphic modular form of level two. I will explain why for the complex projective plane this modular form is a Mock theta function - in fact, it is one of the examples listed in Ramanujan's letter to Hardy to undermine a notoriously obscure definition. In joint work with Ken Ono, we then proved that its cusp contributions are the Donaldson invariants of $CP^2$, a conjecture made by Moore and Witten. Time permitting, I will also sketch how string theory suggests a connection of this construction to a generalized elliptic genus.",

        "description": "Organizations collect personal information while providing an ever-expanding set of services. The collected data can support various “secondary” uses and to protect privacy, various law requires information be rendered “de-identified” before it is repurposed. However, a growing body of evidence suggests data can be “re-identified” and the viability of such laws have been questioned.  I will review how and why re-identification occurs, but also push the discussion from a deterministic view (i.e., re-identification can or cannot occur) toward a probabilistic view (i.e., the likelihood of re-identification).  In doing so, I will illustrate how to construct efficient de-identification algorithms that mitigate risks without precluding the secondary endeavors.  This work will draw upon experience and case studies from with multiple medical centers around the United States.

        "description": "A classic result of G. A. Dirac in graph theory asserts that every n-vertex graph $(n > 2)$ with minimum degree at least n/2 contains a spanning (so-called Hamilton) cycle.  G. Y. Katona and H. A. Kierstead  suggested a possible extension of this result for k-uniform hypergraphs.  There a Hamilton cycle of an n-vertex hypergraph corresponds to an ordering of the vertices such that every k consecutive (modulo n) vertices in the ordering form an edge. Moreover, the minimum degree is the minimum $(k- 1)$-degree, i.e. the minimum number of edges containing a fixed set of k - 1 vertices. V. Rodl, A. Rucinski, and E. Szemeredi verified (approximately) the conjecture of Katona and Kierstead and showed that every n-vertex, k-uniform hypergraph with minimum $(k-1)$-degree $(1/2 + o(1))n$ contains such a tight Hamilton cycle. We study the similar question for Hamilton r-cycles.\\\\\n\\\\\nA Hamilton r-cycle in an n-vertex, k-uniform hypergraph $(1 < r < k)$ is an ordering of the vertices  and an ordered subset of the edges such that each such edge corresponds to k consecutive (modulo n) vertices and two consecutive edges intersect in precisely r vertices.  We prove sufficient (and approximately best possible) minimum $(k-1)$-degree conditions for Hamilton r-cycles if $r < k/2$ and minimum 1-degree conditions for Hamilton 1-cycles in 3-uniform hypergraphs.

        "description": "Preserving the privacy of medical related data becomes even more challenging when the data is obtained from longitudinal studies that were designed to create unique profiles of individual participants. These studies may create participant profiles where each corresponding record is so unique that traditional anonymization techniques cannot be used to generalize and de-identify the record. Therefore sharing of this data with external parties becomes a lengthy process of negotiating specific use agreements. In some cases, sharing of the data among researchers within the organization that owns the data also risks privacy.  Even when traditional identifiers are removed, the uniqueness of these records makes re-identification probable for anyone who has access to the complete record. During this talk, I will present a case study of a Kinsey dataset and discuss the challenges of protecting high dimensional data.\\\\\n\\\\\nBio: Raquel Hill is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science in the School of Informatics and Computing.

Our algorithm succeeds with high probability against an adaptive adversary, which can take over processors at any time during the protocol, up to the point of taking over arbitrarily close to a 1/3 fraction. Moreover, our algorithm works in the presence of flooding: processors controlled by the adversary can send out any number of messages. We assume the existence of private channels between all pairs of processors but make no other cryptographic assumptions. Finally, our algorithm has latency that is polylogarithmic in n. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first\nalgorithm to solve Byzantine agreement against an adaptive adversary, while requiring o($n^2$) total bits of communication.\\\\\n\\\\\n\nJared Saia obtained his PhD from the University of Washington and is now an Associate Professor at the University of New Mexico.

We establish the degree Ramsey number exactly for double stars and for the cycle on four vertices.  We prove that the degree Ramsey number of the n-cycle  is at most 96 when n is even and at most 3458 in general.  Consequently, there are very sparse graphs that arrow large cycles.  We present a family of graphs in which the degree Ramsey number of G is bounded by a function of the maximum degree of G and ask which graph families have this property.

        "description": "Healthcare has lagged behind other industries in the utilization of information technology. Some reasons for this gap are related to the complex nature of physician-patient interactions, lack of systems that can seamlessly be embedded in clinical workflows, and limited collaboration and communication that cross the boundaries between medicine, computer science, and engineering. Changes in the healthcare landscape in the U.S. provide a unique opportunity to develop new ideas for integrating information technology into healthcare. Reducing costs and providing healthcare for all requires the development of more efficient systems of care, in which not only public health indicators and institutional expenditures are monitored, but also objective quality of care measures and individual patient outcomes. High resolution monitoring cannot be achieved without computer-based systems that are able to integrate data from clinical encounters, billing systems, and research studies for meaningful data analysis, pattern recognition, and high fidelity simulations.\n\nThere are a variety of areas in which computer scientists can partner with clinicians and other decision makers, but the development of such partnerships requires a systematic approach. In biomedical informatics training programs, the goal is to provide training in a complementary area for individuals with computer science or health sciences backgrounds, and to train the next generation of researchers. While this covers important ground, more needs to be done. There is currently limited work in the area of training the existing generation of computer scientists and clinician leaders on how to work together to approach current healthcare challenges in a novel way. I will present a model for crossing disciplinary and geographical barriers in order to promote health and alleviate the burden of disease, and present several examples in which this could be done today.\n\nBiography: Lucila Ohno-Machado, MD, PhD, is Professor of Medicine and founding chief of the Division of Biomedical Informatics at the University of California San Diego.

In this talk we review a level-set method for the free surface capturing and some existing approaches of surface PDEs numerical treatment. Further we focus on a new finite element method for the discretization of elliptic partial differential equations on surfaces. It appears that the method is particularly suitable for problems in which  there is a coupling of the problem in the outer domain  with the equation on a surface  and the surface is given implicitly and may vary in time.

        "description": "Researchers usually use several assumptions when they tackle the image deblurring problem.  In particular, it is usually assumed that the blur is known exactly, and that the true image scene outside the field of view is approximated well by periodic boundary conditions.  These assumptions are certainly not true in most realistic situations.\\\\\n\\\\\nIn this thesis we develop a new method to derive adaptive synthetic boundary conditions directly from the blurred images.\nCompared with classical boundary conditions, our approach gives better deblurring results, especially for motion blurred images.  To speed up the deblurring algorithms, we also develop a new regularized DCT preconditioner.\\\\\n\\\\\nWe have written two new software packages to facilitate research in image deblurring.  The first one PYRET is a serial CPU implementation in Python.  With the object-oriented paradigm, we implement  numerical algorithms for the general linear problem, and then specialize them for deblurring problems with a new matrix class.  A web user interface for PYRET is also provided. \\\\\n\\\\\nThe second software package PARRET is a parallel implementation on NVIDIA CUDA GPU architecture. GPUs provide an economical way to obtain parallel processing power.  On a consumer laptop equipped with a GPU,\nwe can attain orders of magnitude speedup with PARRET.\\\\\n\\\\\nFinally, we consider a blind deconvolution problem in which the involved atmospheric blurs are not known in advance.\nWe first reduce the number of variables using a variable projection technique, then solve the reduced problem\nby the Gauss-Newton algorithm.  With careful mathematical manipulation, the Jacobian matrix is decomposed into a series of diagonal and Fourier matrices for inexpensive multiplication. To further improve the deblurring quality, we use more than one blurred image from the same object.  We use a new decoupling approach for the sparsity of the Jacobian matrix\nin this multi-frame case.  Experiments show that the deblurring result improves when more images are used.\\\\",

        "description": "In this talk three studies will be presented; the first two are application driven, addressing the challenging volume preserving image registration and optimal mass transport problems. The third study is more generic and embarks at the development of a new inexact sequential quadratic programming framework, which can be utilized for a variety of problems.\\\\\n\nImage registration aims at finding a plausible transformation which aligns images taken at different times, different view-points or by different modalities. This problem is ill-posed and therefore, regularization is required. In that study, elastic regularizer is considered along with volume preserving constraint. A numerical framework based on augmented Lagrangian along with geometrical multigrid preconditioner was devised. The proposed algorithm was tested with real data.\\\\\n\nThe optimal mass transport seeks for an optimal way to move a pile of soil from one site to another using minimal energy, while preserving the overall mass. In that study, a fluid dynamics formulation was considered. This formulation introduces an artificial time stepping, which on the one hand transforms the non-convex problem to a convex one, but on the other hand increases the dimensionality of the problem. A Schur complement and algebraic multigrid formed a preconditioner within a sequential quadratic programming scheme. Results for both three dimensional as well as four dimensional problems were presented.\\\\\n\nAs the two problems above indicated, discretize-then-optimize approach entails large-scale optimization problem. Inside each step of nonlinear optimization, solution for an ill-conditioned, indefinite linear system, known as a KKT system is required. As problem size increases, linear iterative solvers become the bottleneck of the optimization scheme. Although custom-made solutions for each problem can be formulated, more generic resolution is often desired. In the third study, a new approach for inexact step computation is proposed. The general idea is to reduce the number of linear iteration while still maintaining convergence of the overall scheme. This is done, by the embedment of a filter inside a linear solver. The filter serves as decision-maker for step acceptance, and thereby offers robust, and yet prompt convergence.",

As such, programmers have been unable to design Go AI programs that exceed the level of intermediate human players.  By using techniques of combinatorial theory, mathematicians have recently developed methods of determining optimal play on certain classes of Go positions.  It is our goal to present a survey of these analytic methods.  We will first provide an introduction on the rules of Go as well as relevant concepts of combinatorial game theory.  We will then proceed to solve several categories of small Go positions and finally show how to determine perfect play on a full size Go endgame by way of partitioning into solvable subgames.",

        "description": "Many problems in medicine are governed by a models with unknown parameters. To have a meaningful representation of the model, these parameters need to be evaluated from observations. Experimentalists face the dilemma between accuracy of the parameters and costs of an  \nexperiment. The choice of the design of an experiment is important if we are to recover precise model parameters. It is important to know  \nwhen and what kind of observations should be taken. Taking the wrong measurement can lead to inaccurate estimation of parameters, thus  \nresulting in inaccurate representations of the dynamical system. Each experiment has its own specific challenges. However, optimization  \nmethods form the basic computational tool to address eminent questions of optimal experimental design.  We present a methodology for the design of such experiments that can optimally recover parameters in a dynamical system, biomedical systems in particular. We show that the problem can be cast as a stochastic bilevel optimization problem. We then develop an effective algorithm that allows for the solution of the design problem. The advantages of our approach are demonstrated on a few basic biological models as well as a design problem for the energy metabolism to estimate insulin resistance.",

CVTs have many uses and applications, a non-exhaustive list of which includes data compression, image segmentation and edge detection, clustering, cell biology, territorial behavior of animals, resource allocation, stippling, grid generation in volumes and on surfaces, meshless computing, hypercube sampling, and reduced-order modeling.

        "description": "QoS support for power-constrained wireless mesh networks (WMNs) poses a significant challenge. WMNs are increasingly used as multi-purpose networks, i.e.,  they serve multiple  objectives and different applications simultaneously. As a consequence, a one-size-fits-all routing solution is difficult to achieve, particularly when the performance and QoS expectations of these applications differ. This talk discusses Configurable Mesh Routing (CMR), a toolkit that supports the discovery and management of routes based on any combination of a number of supported QoS metrics. This enables network users to deploy customized routes that meet their unique\nneeds.",

        "description": "A classical result of Scharlau gives that $N_{L/k}(G_L(q_L)) \\subset G_k(q)$ where $q$ is a quadratic form over a field $k$  of characteristic different from 2, $L$ is a finite extension of $k$ and $G_k(q)$ is the set of similarity factors of $q$ in $k$. If $D_k(q)$ denotes the set of values of $q$ in $k$, and $[D_k(q)]$ is the subgroup it generates in $k$, another classical result, this time due to Knebusch, gives $N_{L/k}(D_L(q_L)) \\subset [D_k(q_k)]$. In a 1993 paper, Gille proved a norm principle which generalized that of Knebusch and also implied a partial version of Scharlau's norm principle. Then in 1996, Merkurjev proved a norm principle which implied Gille's norm principle. Gille considered a $k$-isogeny of semisimple algebraic groups $1 \\rightarrow \\mu \\rightarrow G^{\\prime} \\rightarrow G \\rightarrow 1$ over a field $k$ of characteristic 0.  He showed that the norm of the image of $RG(L)$ in $H^1(L,\\mu)$ under the usual connecting map, is in the image of $RG(k)$ in $H^1(k,\\mu)$ where $RG(k)$ is the set of elements of $G(k)$ $R$-equivalent to 1. Merkurjev considered short exact sequences $1 \\rightarrow G_1 \\rightarrow G \\rightarrow T \\rightarrow 1$ where $G_1$ and $G$ are connected reductive groups and $T$ is an algebraic torus defined over a perfect field $k$. He showed that the norm of the image of $RG(L)$ in $T(L)$ is in the image of $RG(k)$ in $T(k)$. We will discuss Gille and Merkurjev's norm principles and show how they imply at least partial versions of the previous results. Then we will illustrate how Merkurjev used his norm principle to give an explicit description of the image of $RG(k)$ in $T(k)$ and give that description in some specific examples.",

        "date": "2010-03-02",
        "description": "We will discuss the connection between optimal transport and the near-field reflector problem. In the near-field reflector problem, we are given a point source of light with some radiation intensity and a target set at a finite distance. The design problem consists of constructing a reflector that reflects the rays emitted by the source so that a given irradiance distribution on the target is produced.  \\\\\n\\\\\nIn recent years, the optimal transport framework has been applied successfully to various open problems in the design of free-form lenses and reflectors. In this talk, we will investigate the near-field problem in this context. In particular, we will see that the notion of a weak solution to the near-field problem as an envelope of ellipsoids of revolution leads to a generalized Legendre transform. Aside from some interesting properties of this transform, it also gives rise to a variational problem that is naturally associated with the near-field reflector problem.  Furthermore, the resulting variational problem resembles a generalized optimal transport problem and exhibits interesting analogies to other optimal transport problems arising in optical design and geometry, particularly to the far-field reflector problem. However, we will see that for the near-field problem the solutions to the associated variational problem do not solve the reflector problem in general.  This is in strong contrast to the problems that have been studied previously in the optimal transport framework. Interestingly, we can still establish a connection between the solutions to the near-field problem and the variational problem. In particular, for discrete target sets we will present an approximation result, which shows that under a suitable choice of the admissible set the variational solution produces an irradiance distribution arbitrarily close to the prescribed irradiance distribution.",

        "description": "In probabilistic percolation models (such as the Ising model for ferromagnetism), the sites of a lattice are randomly set to be active or inactive through an independent Bernoulli process.  The system then evolves through simple deterministic growth rules that allow active sites to ``flow'' to inactive neighbors; for example, an inactive site may become active if at least two of its neighbors are active.  These systems are very interesting due to the fact that they possess critical behavior, which means that there is a sharp density cutoff below which the system experiences very little growth, and above which almost every site is likely to eventually become active.  Furthermore, as the size of the lattice grows to infinity, the critical probability approaches zero, and the critical window follows a finite-size (threshold) scaling relationship in this limit.\n\nAmazingly, this limiting process also leads to the surprise appearance of functions of combinatorial and number theoretic interest, including Ramanujan's famous mock theta functions as well as the generating functions for partitions without sequences.  The interplay between combinatorial probability, hypergeometric q-series, and automorphic forms leads to new proofs of conjectures posed by both probabilists and number theorists, involving slow convergence results for metastability thresholds and improved asymptotics for the generating functions of partitions without k-sequences.",

        "description": "The information revolution has produced huge quantities of knowledge\nin the form of natural human language. This explosion of data has\npushed natural language processing (NLP) research towards empirical\ndata driven methods, which rely on statistical machine learning. This\neffort has produced numerous high quality tools for processing\nlanguage, including knowledge extraction, information organization and\nautomated translation of numerous languages. With more data and better\nstatistical methods, the state of the art advances. Behind the success\nof this statistical movement is a reliance on statistical methods that\nare susceptible to changes in data, a particular problem for language\ndata which naturally transitions between topical domains, genres,\nformats, dialects and languages. High performing systems fail with\neven subtle changes to language input, like a change in the topic\ndomain.\n\n\nThis talk will survey recent NLP successes in tackling complex natural\nlanguage problems as well as challenges posed by changes in language\ndata. I will present several approaches to solving domain change\nchallenges that adapt a learned statistical model between one source\ndomain and a new different target domain. I describe Confidence\nWeighted Learning, a streaming machine learning algorithm designed for\nthe types of data distributions common in language tasks. I show how\nConfidence Weighted Learning both improves learning in NLP tasks and\ncan be applied to confront the challenges associated with data shifts.\n\n\nBIO:\nMark Dredze is as an Assistant Research Professor in the department of\nComputer Science and a Senior Research Scientist at the Human Language\nTechnology Center of Excellence at The Johns Hopkins University.

        "description": "With the trend of cloud computing, data and computing are moved away from desktop and are instead provided as a service from the cloud. Data-as-a-service enables access to a wealth of data across distributed and heterogeneous data sources in the cloud. It remains a challenge, however, to ensure the privacy, interoperability, and scalability for such services.\\\\\n\\\\\nWe designed and developed DObjects, a general-purpose P2P-based query and data operations infrastructure that can be deployed in the cloud and provides access to heterogeneous data sources. The system builds on top of a distributed mediator-wrapper architecture where individual system nodes serve as mediators and/or wrappers and interact with each other in a P2P fashion what guarantees good scalability. As an analogy, the system nodes can be considered as droplets, small elements that provide similar functionality in the cloud. Just as thousands or millions of droplets form a single drop in nature, in cloud computing, groups of droplets that provide similar functionality can form a micro-cloud. Micro-clouds are an integral part of the whole cloud computing system and can provide specific services to users.\\\\\n\\\\\nThe dissertation also discusses the novel dynamic query execution engine within the data query infrastructure that dynamically adapts to network and node (or droplet) conditions.  The query processing is capable of fully benefiting from all the distributed resources to minimize the query response time and maximize system throughput. In addition to leveraging the traditional distributed query optimization techniques, the (sub)queries are deployed and executed on droplets in a dynamic and iterative manner in order to guarantee the best reaction to network and resource dynamics.\\\\\n\\\\\nFinally, the dissertation presents an extension to the basic DObjects model that enables access to private data that is distributed and needs anonymization. The extension enables droplets to form virtual groups in order to addresses two important privacy issues for the sensitive data: privacy of data subjects and confidentiality of data providers. The dissertation discusses decentralized protocols that enable data sharing for horizontally partitioned databases given these constraints. These protocols can be run by the groups of droplets. Concretely, given a query spanning multiple databases, the query results do not contain individually identifiable information.  In addition, institutions do not reveal their databases to each other apart from the query results.",

We conducted a study of human tutoring in the domain of Computer Science data structures, to understand which features and strategies of human tutoring are important for learning. We developed an Intelligent Tutoring System, iList, that helps students learn linked lists. One of the main advancements in iList is the presence of a Procedural Knowledge Model automatically extracted from student data. This model allows iList to provide effective reactive and proactive procedural feedback while a student is solving a problem. We tested five different versions of iList, differing in the level of feedback they can provide, in multiple classrooms, with a total of more than 200 students. The evaluation study showed that iList is effective in helping students learn; students liked working with the system; and the feedback generated by the most sophisticated versions of the system is helpful in keeping the students on the right path. \\\\ Davide Fossati (http://www.fossati.us) received his Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago in summer 2009.

However, large graphs may often be disk resident, and such graphs cannot be efficiently processed. In this talk, we examine the issues of on-line analytic processing, summarization and indexing of large graphs. Specifically, the problem of connectivity in the context of massive graphs is considered. In many large communication networks, social networks and other graphs, it is desirable to determine the minimum-cut between any pair of nodes. We will discuss how a connectivity index can be developed for a massive-disk resident graph. A sampling based approach is deployed to create compressed representations of the underlying graph.

Helicity is a conserved quantity of inviscid flow, is cascaded jointly with energy through the inertial range, and is physically interpreted to be the degree to which a flow's vortex lines are tangled and intertwined.  Until recently however, helicity has been ignored in NSE computations.  In this talk I will show how helicity can be more accurately treated in finite element computations of the 3D NSE, which in turn leads to more accurate simulations.  I will discuss two numerical schemes: one which enforces helicity preservation by the NSE nonlinearity (to mimic the continuous case) - joint work with Vince Ervin, and a second that solves for helicity directly inside of a velocity-vorticity method - joint work with Maxim Olshanskii.  Numerical examples will be given that demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods.",

This presentation will describe a grid-based software system that is under development at Emory, the Analytic Information Warehouse (AIW), that aims to facilitate discovery and query of those patterns. The AIW will provide controlled\nterminology support in queries. It will also provide analytic services for extracting concepts from unstructured text, de-identification, discovering features of a patient population and predicting responses and outcomes. Schema adaptors will support connecting to Emory Healthcare's existing clinical data warehouse and other research and clinical databases with appropriate levels of security.

To send someone a secret message, you need two things: (1) a message scrambler (\"the cryptosystem\"), and (2) a piece of information that tells the sender and the receiver just how the scrambling is done (\"the key\"). Keeping the key in the right hands and out of the wrong hands is a major problem for cryptographers, and public key cryptography is a solution to this problem that is at work on every computer and in every network in the world.  This talk is about Chocolate Key Cryptography, which is a way to describe a certain public key cryptosystem that is easy to learn, fun, interactive, and delicious.\n\n\nBiographical Sketch: Ezra (Bud) Brown grew up in New Orleans, has degrees from Rice and LSU, and has been at Virginia Tech since 1969, where he is currently Alumni Distinguished Professor of Mathematics.

        "description": "Missing web pages (pages that return the \"404 Page Not Found\" error) are part of the browsing experience.  So too are pages whose owners failed to renew their domain and whose old URls now have unexpected content.  Users that encounter a missing page or unexpected page may try to use search engines to discover either the same page at a new location or a similar, \"good enough\" page to satisfy their information needs, but this can be laborious.  To address this need, we are developing a semi-automated framework to assist users to first discover the topic of the missing page, and then locate the same or similar page at a new URl.\\\\\n\\\\\nWe have been investigating a number of techniques to discover the \"aboutness\" of an unknown web page.  If the page is in the internet Archive's Wayback Machine or in a search engine cache, the user may be satisfied with the old copy.  If an old copy is insufficient, we can use either the page's title or generate a lexical signature to serve as a queiry to a search engine to find the resource.  A lexcial signature is a 5-7 word \"abstract\" of a document that is suitable for using as a queiry to a search engine.  The performance of titles and lexcial signatures are comparable, with both achieving over 60 percent success.  The combination of titles and lexical signatures from link neighborhoods as well as using tags from del.icio.us, but at this point neither method performs well.\\\\\n\\\\\nSpeaker Bio:\\\\\nMichael L.

A major improvement from a theoretical point of view as well as for practical applications is the design of free-form lenses and mirrors. The optimal transport approach has been applied to a variety of design problems for systems consisting of one or two lenses or reflectors. A classical problem in optical design is the so-called illumination or near-field single reflector problem. In this problem, one needs to design a reflecting surface such that the rays emitted from a non-isotropic source are reflected in such a way to create a prescribed in advance illumination pattern on a given target set at a finite distance. In this talk, we will discuss how the near-field problem fits into a generalized optimal transport framework and how solutions to this transport problem are related to solutions of the near-field problem.",

In this talk, we show that if the graph has girth five, one can actually find an independent dominating set of roughly the same size,\n(n log(d))/d + O(n/d).  This extends results of Duckworth and Wormald who studied the problem on random regular graphs, and up to the implied constant is sharp.

        "description": "Role based access control is well accepted as the standard best practice for access control within applications and organizations.  Role engineering, the task of defining roles and associating permissions to them, is essential to realize the full benefits of the role-based access control paradigm. The essential question is how to devise a complete and correct set of roles --  this depends on how you define goodness/interestingness (when is a role good/interesting?) We define the role mining problem (RMP) as the problem of discovering an optimal set of roles from  existing user permissions. In addition to the above basic RMP, we introduce two different variations of the RMP, called the delta-approx RMP and the Minimal Noise RMP that have pragmatic implications. Our main contribution is to formally define RMP, analyze its theoretical bounds, and present heuristic solutions to find the optimal set of roles based on subset enumeration. We place this in the framework of matrix decomposition which is applicable to many other domains including text mining. \\\\\n\\\\\nBio:\\\\\n\\\\\nDr. Vijay Atluri received her Ph.D. in Information Technology from George Mason University, USA.

Both results avoid the prime $p$ because in that case there is no good theory of ramification of Brauer group elements.  However, one can try and avoid this obstacle by defining the ramification group of a discrete valued field $K$ with valuation ring $R$ as the quotient of Brauer groups $Br(K)/Br(R)$ and then study the functorial properties of this quotient. One is then led to the complete case and to consider the paper ``A generalization of local class field theory by using K groups I'' by Kazuya Kato (J Fac Sci Sec. IA 26, 2 303-376).

Giroux's correspondence relates open book decompositions of a manifold M to contact structures on M. This correspondence has been fundamental to our understanding of contact geometry. An intriguing question raised by this correspondence is how geometric properties of a contact structure are reflected in the monodromy map describing the open book decomposition. In this talk I will show that there are several interesting monoids in the mapping class group that are related to various properties of a contact structure (like being Stein fillable, weakly fillable, . . .). I will also show that there are open book decompositions of Stein fillable contact structures whose monodromy cannot be factored as a product of positive Dehn twists.

        "description": "\\small\nDigital identity management (DIM) has emerged as a critical foundation for supporting successful interaction in today's globally interconnected society. It is crucial not only for the conduct of business and government but also for a large and growing body of electronic or online social interactions. Digital identity management is usually coupled with the notion of federation. The goal of federations is to provide users with protected environments to federate identities by the proper management of identity attributes.  Federations provide a controlled method by which federation members can provide more integrated and complete services to a qualified group of individuals within certain sets of business transactions. By controlling the scope of access to participating sites, and by enabling secure, cross-domain transmission of user's personal information, federations can make the perpetration of identity frauds more difficult, as well as reduce their frequency, and their potential impact. In this talk we will first discuss basic digital identity concepts and requirements towards DIM solutions and we will overview relevant initiatives currently undergoing in academia and industry.  We will then focus on the problem of identity theft and discuss an initial solution to the problem of establishing and protecting digital identity.\\\\\n\\\\*\n\\textbf{Biography:}\nElisa Bertino is professor of Computer Science at Purdue University and serves as Research Director of the Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security (CERIAS).

Since contextual information affects significantly the choices\nof topics and words made by authors, in general, it is very important to\nincorporate it in analyzing and mining text data. In this talk, I will\npresent a new paradigm of text mining, called contextual text mining, where\ncontext is treated as a \"first-class citizen.\" I will introduce general ways\nof modeling and analyzing various kinds of context in text, including simple\ncontext, implicit context, and complex context, in the framework of\nprobabilistic language models.

The problem here is that two\nmethods with different structures are being combined, which introduces\nadditional complexity in the convergence analysis of multi-grid methods.\nThen, the idea is to avoid the use of smoothing iterations by using\ndifferent inter-grid configurations. In an analogy with perfect\nreconstruction filters, a configuration of inter-grid operators is found\nsuch that the approximation error is completely cancelled after one\niteration of the algorithm.

Regularization methods exist for computing stable solution approximations, but many of these methods are inadequate or insufficient for solving large-scale problems.  This work addresses these limitations by developing advanced numerical methods to solve ill-posed inverse problems and by implementing high-performance parallel code for large-scale applications.  Three mathematical models that frequently arise in imaging applications are considered: linear least squares, nonlinear least squares, and nonlinear Poisson maximum likelihood.  Hybrid methods are developed for regularization of linear least squares problems, variable projection algorithms are used for nonlinear least squares problems, and reconstruction algorithms are investigated for nonlinear Poisson based models.  Furthermore, an efficient parallel implementation based on the Message Passing Interface (MPI) library is described for use on state-of-the-art computer architectures.  Numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods on problems from image reconstruction, super-resolution imaging, cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction, and digital tomosynthesis.",

It is therefore\ndesirable to understand how a typical subgraph relates to the\nunderlying host graph.\n\nWe consider several interrelated problems involving both random trees\nin host graphs and random subgraphs obtained by taking edges of the\nhost graph independently with probability p. In the second case,\nwe study the emergence of the giant component. We also use the\nspectral gap to understand discrepancy and expansion properties\nof a random subgraph.\n\nThe Erdos-Renyi random graph is the special case of this where the\nhost graph is the complete graph Kn. Additional applications include\ntaking a contact graph as the host graph, and viewing random subgraphs\nas outbreaks of a disease.",

The Kirchhoff polynomial of $P(G)$ is a certain homogeneous polynomial in $E$ variables whose degree is the first Betti number of the graph. These polynomials appeared classically in the study of electrical circuits (e.g., Kirchhoff's laws). They also appear in the evaluation of Feynman integrals. Motivated by computer calculations of D.~Kreimer and D.J.~Broadhurst associating multiple zeta values to certain Feynman integrals, Kontsevich conjectured that the number of zeros of $P(G)$ over a field with $q$ elements is a polynomial function of $q$.   P.~Belkale and I disproved this conjecture by relating the schemes $V(P(G))$ to the representation spaces of certain combinatorial objects called matroids.  I will discuss this work and subsequent work on the number-theoretical properties of Feynman amplitudes.",

        "description": "A new convergence result for an Iteratively Regularized Gauss Newton (IRGN) algorithm with a Tikhonov regularization term using a seminorm generated by a linear operator will be presented [SRK07]. The convergence theorem uses an a posteriori stopping rule and a modified source condition, without any restriction on the nonlinearity of the operator.  The theoretical results are illustrated by simulations for a 2D version of the exponentially ill-posed optical tomography inverse problem for the diffusion and absorption coefficient spatial distributions. The modified Tikhonov regularization performs the mapping of the minimization variables, which are the coefficients of the spline expansions for the diffusion and absorption, to physical space. This incorporates the inherently differing scales of these variables in the minimization, and also suggests relative weighting of the regularization terms with respect to each parameter space. The modified IRGN allows greater flexibility for implementations of iteratively regularized solutions of ill-posed inverse problems in which differing scales in physical space hinder standard IRGN inversions.",

        "description": "Suppose we have a collection of sensors in a large region, each of which can detect events within a disk of radius 1. We wish to devise a schedule so that each sensor can sleep for much of the time, while making sure that the whole region is covered by the sensors that are awake. A natural way of doing this is to partition the sensors into k subsets, each subset of sensors covering the whole region. Then in time slot t we activate all the sensors in subset (t mod k). If this is possible we say the sensors are k-partitionable. An obvious necessary condition is that each point in the region is covered by at least k sensors (k-coverage), but this is not in general sufficient. We show that for random deployments of sensors k-coverage usually implies k-partitionability, and identify the most likely obstructions to k-partitionability when this fails. This leads to some natural unsolved problems involving k-partitionability of (deterministic) configurations of disks. This is joint work with B. Bollobas, A. Sarkar, and M. Walters.",

A key challenge in this integration is to keep the SAT encoding of SQL constraints small.  In this work, we describe a divide-and- conquer technique for reducing the encoding of cardinality constraints.  We present a number of experiments to show the improvements on performance.",
